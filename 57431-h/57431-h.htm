</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this final documentary volume of our series we
present matter which is planned to bring out the salient points of the
highly important period from 1841 to 1898, a little more than the last
half-century of the Spanish r&eacute;gime, together with such
bibliographical aids as will enable students to find readily the best
and most available sources for the history of that time. The first two
documents (written respectively by a civil official and a military
commander) furnish a reliable and intelligent survey, by eyewitnesses,
of political, economic, and social conditions in the islands in
1842&ndash;43; and thus supplement the similar relations (in
<span class="sc">VOL. LI</span>) dated fifteen years earlier. The
admirable paper by James A. LeRoy who is well known as the leading
authority on Philippine affairs, places before our readers a clear and
orderly review of the last four decades of Spanish rule in
Filipinas&mdash;with keen but impartial comments on conditions, events,
and men therein; and with full and well-selected bibliographical
references to the best works on the subject. It gives us pleasure to
present here the hitherto unpublished constitution of the Liga
Filipina, from Rizal&rsquo;s own MS. draft; and the friar memorial of
1898 (a curiously medi&aelig;val document for the end of the nineteenth
century), which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>heretofore had appeared only in a limited Spanish
edition and a partial and unsatisfactory English translation. To these
documents is added an appendix on agricultural conditions in Filipinas,
giving a view of these in 1784 and another in 1866; an outline of the
projects, efforts, and achievements of the noted Economic Society of
Manila; and bibliographical references for the use of the reader.
Following is a synopsis of the above documents:</p>
<p>Of exceeding interest and importance is the third volume of
Mas&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Informe</i>, on the policy of the Spanish
government as regards internal affairs in the Philippine Islands.
Intended almost exclusively for the use of the government, but
comparatively few copies were published, and hence the volume is of
great rarity, and is not mentioned by most of the bibliographers. We
know with certainty of four copies: two owned in the Philippines, one
by the heirs of Clemente Zulueta, and the other by Epifanio de los
Santos (our translation being made from a typewritten copy of the
latter); one in the Peabody Institute, Baltimore, and one in the
collection of the Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a General de Tabacos de
Filipinas, Barcelona. Its chief value and importance lie in its
treatment of various vital questions that had already begun to present
themselves to some minds more or less clearly&mdash;the relation of the
Filipino-Spaniards to those of the Peninsula; questions concerning the
natives, Chinese mestizos, and Spaniards; separation from Spain; and
lastly, the proposition to free the islands. The document, while
containing many things that are general in nature, and which even
appear childish and visionary, is in many other things clear-sighted,
and shows deep and keen observation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>The first two volumes of
Mas&rsquo;s work (which have been cited so frequently in this series)
were written in order to form a suitable background to the third
volume, and thus lead to it naturally, by giving a r&eacute;sum&eacute;
in succinct form of the history, government, and social and economic
conditions of the islands. Proceeding to his purpose, the author states
that the intentions of Spain in regard to the colony may be one of
three: perpetual possession; utter neglect; or emancipation. He treats
only of the first and third. To ensure perpetual possession, there are
three principles to be borne in mind and acted upon: the reduction of
the white population; the subordination of the natives; and the general
reform of the Spanish administration. The growth of the white
population fosters the spirit of independence, for the Spaniards of the
Philippines look upon the islands as their own country, and have no
affection for Spain. Their only concern is to hold possession of the
government posts, but they are lazy and ignorant. They are naturally
disgruntled by the appointment of peninsular Spaniards to posts in the
islands; for, since the promotions are limited, they cannot hope for
the advancement that they believe is due them. Their discontent was
seen in practical form in the insurrection instigated in 1822 because
of the officials brought from Spain by Antonio Martinez; and there was
evident discontent because of the new contingent that appeared in 1825.
There are more than one thousand Filipino-Spanish males in the
Philippines, but only four hundred posts, and their hopes continually
wane at the appearance of officials from Spain, although Spain has an
evident right to send whom it will to the islands. To obviate the
trouble, Mas suggests that only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16"
href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>single men be sent to the
islands from Spain to act as officials, and that they be required to
return to the Peninsula after twenty years&rsquo; service, with the
option of returning in ten years. These men will probably marry Spanish
women in the islands, and on their return to Spain will take their
families with them, thus reducing the white population considerably. It
is a mistake to send women to the colony, and a grave error to endeavor
to increase the white population there. A plan is proposed for the
further reduction of the white population by sending all males to Spain
at the government expense, at the age of sixteen, where they shall be
educated at the expense of the Manila treasury. The sending of the
situado from Spain for the support of the islands was formerly a large
factor in keeping the colony loyal, but since that has become
unnecessary the one great check on the colony has disappeared. But
separation now would mean that the whites would disappear in the mass
of the natives, and would even become inferior to them. It is wrong to
infer that the whites and the natives will work together, for there is
a barrier between them, and the recent outbreak in Tayabas cannot in
any way be ascribed to the former. The salvation of the whites lies in
agriculture, and great profits are to be acquired therein, although the
Spaniards are loath to engage in such work. Their fields can be
cultivated by Chinese labor, and by captured Moros, and contracts can
be made, in addition, with individual Filipinos, under certain
exemptions. Mas favors the system of indentured servants, for
self-interest will dictate good treatment to them. To ensure native
respect for the whites, the education of the former must be very
restricted, and the colleges at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17"
href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>Manila be closed. Filipino
soldiers shall not rise above the rank of private or corporal. Filipino
secular priests must be reduced in numbers, and must, in general, act
only as the assistants of the regulars. Filipinos cannot maintain the
dignity of the priestly office, and instead debauch it, as Mas proves
by various letters. Religion is the mainstay of the islands, and the
regular curas must be given as much power as possible, and officials
must work in harmony with them. The friars must, however, live morally,
abstain from trade, and not meddle in temporal affairs. Emancipation
will be the ruin of the friars; and, in order that they may conserve
Spanish interests, all the curas must be Spaniards from Spain. Curas
lose respect among the natives because they are compelled to collect
the marriage and burial fees, and the government should come to their
aid by collecting these under the form of a specified tax. Above all,
the whites must observe religious ceremonies, which they now almost
utterly neglect. The laws of the Indias are executed too rigidly, and
are too favorable to the natives. The latter are becoming arrogant and
impudent, and will end by driving out the Spaniards. Mas would require
a distinctive dress for the natives, the chiefs to be the only ones who
may wear jackets. The priests have been guilty of destroying rank among
them. Natives must salute all Spaniards and show great outward respect.
The title of &ldquo;Don&rdquo; must be given them no longer, for this
gives the idea of equality with the whites. All government officials
must be given decent pay, and must be made to spend it liberally.
Offices should not be given in order that their incumbents may amass
money. Only Spaniards of good character should be allowed to go to the
islands. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>If the treasury officials are decreased in number
and the collections farmed out, this work should be done by natives and
mestizos, as this is an odious office, and engenders much ill-will.
Race hatred must be developed between the Filipinos and Chinese
mestizos as much as possible. The latter are the richer and more
intelligent, and in case of emancipation at this moment would soon gain
the upper hand. They are hated by the natives. It is highly important
to have a respectable and moral Spanish force in the islands, for
should the native troops mutiny nothing can be done as matters now
stand. Curas should have the power of intervention in the meetings of
the principales, as this method will avoid conspiracy. Natives should
not be taught how to cast artillery or make firearms and powder.
Indeed, the powder factory recently established should be suppressed,
as the contract under which it was allowed is not advantageous, and
better powder is manufactured in Murcia. Steam vessels are needed for
quick communication among the islands, and to repel Moro invasions, and
suppress insurrections. Spanish should not be taught to the natives.
Newspapers may be allowed, under proper censorship; and curas should
translate into the native dialect such articles as are important for
the natives. A complete system of police is necessary. Trouble is to be
expected from China, but it will be quite safe to allow the entrance of
a certain number of Chinese laborers to work on the estates of the
whites. They can be counted on in case of trouble with the natives, and
in case they themselves revolt native hatred will soon finish them. It
is advisable to watch the intercourse between foreigners living in the
islands and the natives. A complete reform is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>needed
in the administration of the government, which, as now constituted, is
honeycombed with laxity and graft. The laws of the Indias are confused
and contradictory, as is proved by numerous citations. Government is
too little centralized. Spanish statesmen have been guilty of strange
errors in regard to the Philippines, through their ignorance. Mas
proposes a regency of three men, the president to be a Spanish grandee.
The duties of this body are outlined, which in general correspond to
those of the governor-general and Audiencia. The plan contemplates a
Council of State; and thorough judiciary reforms, in order to render
the judiciary independent of the government. The prestige of rank is to
be observed, as this is a large factor in preserving the <i lang=
"la">status quo</i>. In the provinces, the provincial chiefs (who are
to be sent from Spain) shall hold all the power, as at present. The
treasury reforms suggested look toward a lessening of graft, and
greater economy. In case the Spanish government decides to emancipate
the Philippines, the exactly opposite course must be chosen to the one
outlined so fully for their conservation. Education and the arts must
be encouraged, newspapers allowed with but a mild censorship, and the
population must become amalgamated. To effect the last, dowries should
be paid to the women in all crossed marriages. Native assemblies should
be established in order to train them in political matters. Mas favors
emancipation. The islands have been a drag on Spain from the first,
and, if a violent separation comes, it will result in a further loss of
life and treasure. It is interesting to note that he adds a plea for
the greater humanitarianism of the emancipation plan. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>Matta&rsquo;s report of 1843 in regard to the moral condition of the
Philippines, and the reforms necessary in administrational and economic
matters for the conservation of the islands is of great practical
value. The report was called forth by the sedition of Apolinario, the
founder of the cofradia of San Jos&eacute;, and the revolt in 1843 of a
portion of the troops. It sets forth the loss of prestige by both the
government and the regular clergy (once the prime support of Spanish
authority in the islands), and the confusion that is rife throughout
Manila and the provinces, a state approaching anarchy. Political
factions, the troubles arising from the contradictory character of the
natives, the demoralization in military circles, all demand radical
reforms. A system of law taking into consideration the character of the
natives is needed, as well as greater centralization in the government,
with well defined powers granted to subordinate officials; suppression
of various religious educational institutions as breeders of discontent
and trouble, and the establishment of commercial and other schools;
abolition of the residencia; and other legislative and economic
measures. For the development of the islands capital is needed, but
reform must precede in order that capital may be attracted. Agriculture
is the main support of the islands, and must be developed by the
whites, mestizos, and Chinese, who will support the government, and
thus offset the immense numbers of the natives. The report calls for
extensive military reforms and the establishment of a good police
system. Tag&aacute;log academies are proposed, so that Spanish officers
may learn the native language. It is of great importance to conciliate
both Peninsulars and Spaniards born in the Philippines, and to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>show partiality to neither, in order that
prosperity may reign.</p>
<p>Mr. LeRoy&rsquo;s contribution to this volume consists of two parts:
a general editorial comment on the modern era of the Philippines, and
some bibliographical notes and further comments for the study of that
period. The first shows the influences working in and through the
Philippines and the Filipinos, and is necessarily treated on broad
lines, detail being scrupulously avoided. The second part is written in
the same spirit, but in notes and titles gives the student full
material for the study of the modern era. By the modern era, Mr. LeRoy
means roughly the last half of the nineteenth century, but necessarily,
in speaking of it, he has been compelled to go back to influences
beginning to be felt before that time. Very briefly he sketches the
elements making for a broader life in economic and social and political
lines; the break-down of old ideas, whose longer continuance was
untenable in material, intellectual, and religious progress; and the
rise of the greater respect and self-consciousness of the Filipinos. In
his bibliographical section, the author treats fairly and impartially
of the threefold development of the Filipinos and the Philippines:
viz., the social; the economic&mdash;under which are discussed general
considerations, agriculture, land, etc., the Chinese, industries,
commerce, internal trade, navigation, etc., and currency&mdash;and the
political, under which are discussed the Spanish administration and the
Filipino propaganda and revolution. Under the first division of the
latter are treated the administrative organism, the administration as
actually working, taxation, legal and judicial matters, science and
material resources, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span>the Moros and pagan peoples; and under the
second, the religious question, the friar estates, the Filipino clergy
and their cause, the revolt of 1872, reform and demands for more
&ldquo;assimilation,&rdquo; the propagandists, Masonry, the Liga
Filipina, etc., the Katipunan, the insurrection of 1896&ndash;97, the
pact of Biak-na-bat&oacute; and the question of independence. By its
mass of comment and titles, this section fully supplements the first
part, and presents to the student a comprehensive survey of Philippine
life and development, that will be found the most useful material yet
published for detailed study of the modern era.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Events in Filipinas, 1841&ndash;1872,&rdquo; the attempt
is made only to indicate general conditions in the islands, by citing
very briefly some of the more important matters during that period in
social, religious and economic lines. In addition to this, we have
added a short bibliography, from which the student may gather abundant
and accessible material for this period.</p>
<p>Through the kindness of Sr. Epifanio de los Santos we are enabled to
present in full for the first time the constitution of the Liga
Filipina (which was organized by Rizal on July 3, 1892) from a copy
made from the manuscript of Rizal. This constitution shows the Liga not
to have been formed for the purpose of independence, but for mutual aid
and protection of its members, and the fostering of a more united
spirit among Filipinos. Nowhere does it contain a word against the
sovereignty of Spain or against religion. In it are declared the ends,
form, duties of members and officials, rights of members and officials,
the investment of funds, and general rules. The one exception that
might be taken to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span>constitution is that implicit and
unquestioning obedience to all superior commands is required from the
members.</p>
<p>As the last document proper in this series we present the Friar
Memorial of April 21, 1898, which voices the protest of all the orders
(Augustinians, Franciscans, Recollects, Dominicans, and Jesuits), but
which was destined never to reach officially those for whom it was
intended (the Spanish government, through the minister of the
colonies), because of the appearance in Spanish waters of the American
squadron, and the defeat of the Spanish fleet. It is fitting, however,
to present this document in this series, as it is a complete statement
of the friars&rsquo; standpoint, and especially as the last document of
the series, as it marks the passing of the old Spanish r&eacute;gime.
The beginning and ending alike express the loyalty of the orders to the
Spanish government, and throughout the document is noted the expression
of the patriotism of all the members of the orders as Spaniards. The
memorial, as a whole, is a protest against the charges brought against
the friars from both Spanish and Philippine sources; against
free-thought; against Masonry and other secret societies; against the
secularization of the orders, episcopal visitation, secularization of
schools, and all the other demands of the separatists and insurgents.
That the friars are the cause of the insurrection, they indignantly
deny. They have ever done their duty, and have worked in the interests
of religion and the Spanish fatherland. The insurgents, the
filibusters, the separatists, of both Spain and the islands, have
directed their whole cry against religion in order to veil their real
purpose. The friars have borne all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>vilification that has
been directed against them patiently, but they cannot for their own
honor do so longer. They are proud of their record throughout the
history of the islands, and are mindful that, as the only permanent
peninsular social factor in the Philippines, they have christianized
the islands, have maintained peaceful relations therein, and have kept
them for Spain. Only since the entrance of those imbued with the
revolutionary free-thought, and of Freemasons, have the islands been
disturbed&mdash;a period of about thirty years. The Katipunan society
is nothing else than a society constructed on Masonic principles, and
its rapid diffusion of late throughout many districts greatly
complicates the problem and renders the remedy more difficult. Had the
orders been silent in the face of the attempts of the Masons, of the
filibusters, and of the insurgents, they would not have become an
object of persecution; but since they always stood out for the
traditional religion and for Spain, the storm of abuse and
ill-treatment has fallen upon them. They challenge their detractors and
calumniators to prove charges that they have not fulfilled their duty,
and those of personal immorality. They have not committed abuse in the
taking of parochial fees; they are not hostile to education (indeed,
all the education of the islands has been established and fostered by
them); they do not despise the educated natives, but, as is easily
proved, are good friends with them. Most of the graduates from their
institutions have remained loyal, and the same is generally true of the
wealthy classes. The real cause of the rebellion can be traced back to
the government in allowing the entrance of free-thought into the
islands and the dissemination of Masonic doctrines, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>have led
to the lessening of respect for religion and for Spain; and, as this
has come about, it has been natural for race hatred to spring up. The
only way of obtaining peace is to strengthen the religious life of the
islands, and to force out all the revolutionary forces of free-thought
and Masonry. The mission of the friars must receive government support
and respect, else it will be impossible for them longer to remain in
the islands. They do not desire temporal honors, or to take part in the
civil affairs of government; they are even willing to relinquish the
slight official intervention that they possess: but they must demand
the honor due to religion which has always been theirs by right. They
are governed in their actions by the <i lang="la">Syllabus errorum</i>
of Pius IX. The laws of the Indias, the actions of the sovereigns, the
instructions to Legazpi: all commit Spain to the maintenance of friars
in the Philippines, and to the greater interests of religion. Even
earlier, the <i lang="es">Siete Partidas</i> of Alfonso the Wise
command respect to ecclesiastical persons. This respect, therefore, the
friars demand, if they are longer to remain in the islands, and be the
support of the government. This memorial is one by those who are
fighting for life, and who see dimly ahead the fate that may overtake
them.</p>
<p>The subject of agriculture in the islands is briefly treated in an
appendix, showing conditions in the islands in 1784 and 1866, as
described by Governor Basco and the German traveler Jagor respectively;
the aims and achievements of the Economic Society of Manila; and
references to the more important writings on agriculture in the
islands. All show how backward were the conditions of that industry,
even to the end of the Spanish r&eacute;gime, although various
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>efforts were made by Spain to institute reforms
and promote the cultivation of the soil; but most of these were too
superficial and partial to be successful&mdash;indeed, they were
continually hindered by the whole system of Spanish colonial
administration and the deficiencies in the native character and
training.</p>

the list of &ldquo;Errata and addenda&rdquo; (at the end of this
volume) which is unavoidable in any series so extensive as this.
Therein is contained much information which reached the Editors too
late for insertion in its proper place, or was furnished by those whose
personal knowledge enabled them to correct misstatements in works cited
as authorities. The following persons may be mentioned as meriting
special thanks for aid rendered to the Editors: Manuel de Yriarte,
chief of Division of Archives, Manila; Epifanio de los Santos, Malolos,
Bulacan, Luz&oacute;n; T. H. Pardo de Tavera, of the Philippine
Commission, Manila; and Rev. Anthony Huonder, S.J., Luxembourg,

Volume III. Their internal political condition. Madrid, January,
1843.</i></p>
<p>The twenty-four chapters which I have presented <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>hitherto,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e936src" href=
"#xd27e936" name="xd27e936src">2</a> have only been preliminary
studies, in order that I might treat of the present matter; for it
would be an ill thing to speak of the internal administration of the
country, or of the line of policy that it is of advantage to adopt
therein, without passing in review its anterior data, analyzing its
elements, and forming an opinion of its resources.</p>
<p>The laws of every state must have one object, and the wiser and more
perfect they are, the better they fulfil their end. To discourse, then,
on those laws which are advisable in Filipinas, one must take note of
the intentions that the government may have in regard to the islands.
These intentions will probably be reduced to the following plans or
principles.</p>
<p>To conserve the colony forever, that is to say, without its
separation being even thought of.</p>
<p>To consider indifferently its loss or its conservation, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>and the
fate of the Spaniards living in the colony.</p>
<p>To resolve upon emancipation, and prepare the colony for giving it
freedom.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e949src" href="#xd27e949" name=
"xd27e949src">3</a></p>
<p>In regard to the second of these three fundamental policies, nothing
occurs to me to say, except that it follows in everything, as hitherto.
I shall treat, then, only of the first and last.</p>
<p>In order to conserve the colony, it is necessary, in my opinion, to
work with reference to the spirit of the following three principles,
which I shall endeavor successively to explain: 1st. It is advisable to
reduce the Spanish-Filipino<a class="noteref" id="xd27e959src" href=
"#xd27e959" name="xd27e959src">4</a> population to the least possible
number. 2d. The people of color must voluntarily give respect and
obedience to the whites. 3rd. The general administration demands a
complete reform.</p>
<p>1st. It is advisable to reduce the population, etc. In the epochs
when the light of experience was lacking, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>it was believed that the
most powerful means of assuring the possession of a colony was to
increase the white race therein as much as possible; and, as a school
for this conviction, they preferred to send thither as employes those
who had the most children, especially female. The Council of
Indias<a class="noteref" id="xd27e966src" href="#xd27e966" name=
"xd27e966src">5</a> has, up to its last gasp, given proofs of this
erroneous idea. But since then it has been seen that, in fleeing from
Scylla, it has fallen into Charybdis; for among this white population
born in the country, there is formed a local interest opposed to that
of the mother-country, which begins by creating a discontent, and ends
by suggesting the desire for independence. [Although a
Filipino-Spaniard calls himself a Spaniard, all his sympathies are in
the Philippines, and Spain is only secondary in his thoughts. Generally
the sons or grandsons of government employes, Filipino-Spaniards,
receive but little education, are fond of playing the gentleman, are
lazy and dissipated. Little inclined to a professional or business
career, they put all their efforts on securing a government post. As it
is about one-half of the posts do belong to them, but since the best
posts depend upon the favor of the Madrid ministers, the
Filipino-Spaniards are constantly disappointed in the promotion which
they believe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>belongs to them by right. Consequently, there is
much ill-will and complaint. Camba&rsquo;s pamphlet,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e974src" href="#xd27e974" name="xd27e974src">6</a> although
chiefly written to prove that there was no disloyalty in the
Philippines, yet noted the anger and consequent mutiny (June 2&ndash;3,
1823)<a class="noteref" id="xd27e992src" href="#xd27e992" name=
"xd27e992src">7</a> because of the arrival of Governor J. Antonio
Martinez (October, 1822) with a large staff of Peninsular officials and
sergeants; as well as the displeasure manifested in October, 1825, by
the arrival of a new contingent of civil and military officers with
Governor Mariano Ricafort. Still, it is not right to expect that, so
long as Spain does not intend to abandon the Philippines, it should
refrain from sending Peninsulars to fill the posts there or cease to
exercise the appointing or removing power as it sees fit. If all the
posts are reserved for the Filipino-Spaniards, it cannot be expected
that the islands will remain loyal to a country so distant from them.
In fact, the Filipino-Spaniards, under existing circumstances, cannot
receive greater consideration than at present. The natural and
necessary preference for Peninsulars in the posts of the Philippines
engenders the hatred of the Filipino-Spaniards toward them; but, on the
other hand, this hatred has been greatly exaggerated by the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>Peninsulars, who are intolerant and contemptuous
of the colonials. This contempt, Mas illustrates by two examples, of
which he was an eyewitness. Such things, together with the contemptuous
nickname given them by the Peninsulars, gives rise to much ill-will on
the part of the Filipino-Spaniards, who declare that all the cause of
the enmity between the two classes comes from the former. The real
cause, however, of the hatred, is economic, and a matter of the posts.
Each of the male Filipino-Spaniards is seeking a post, but since there
are only four hundred posts of all kinds in the islands, while the
Filipino-Spaniards number about one thousand, the trouble must be
continuous and must even become exaggerated, just so long as a remedy
is not applied. Such a remedy would be for the government to refuse
them any post in the army or other department of government service in
the Philippines, although recognizing them as Spaniards with full
rights if they come to reside in the Peninsula. Mas proceeds to
elaborate his plan for decreasing the white population of the
Philippines. All Spaniards going from Europe to the Philippines before
the age of fifteen or sixteen must be regarded as Filipino-Spaniards.
It is proposed that only single men be sent to fill posts in the
islands, and that they be compelled to return to the Peninsula after
twenty years, with permission to return in ten if they so please. It
will be natural for these men to marry Filipino-Spanish women, who with
their children will accompany their husbands to the Peninsula at the
end of the twenty years. Transportation should be at national expense.
On a basis of three passages for each family, the cost would be only
450 pesos. Each twenty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"
name="pb35">35</a>]</span>years, there would be one thousand two
hundred return passages to be paid. This would cost only 27,000 pesos
annually. In return, four hundred men would have to be sent to the
islands each twenty years, or with allowance for deaths and other
contingencies, five hundred. At 300 pesos apiece, this would cost
annually 8,750 pesos; and the total transportation expense would be
only 35,750 pesos. Although transportation is not now paid by the
government, the strange mismanagement is practiced of sending married
men with families, thus increasing the white population. On the basis
that there are three thousand five hundred young Filipino-Spaniards in
the islands (both male and female), and reckoning sixty years as the
average life of the individual, there would be fifty-eight and
one-third individuals for each year of the sixty years, of whom
one-half would be women (and hence eligible for marriage with the
Peninsulars). All the males shall be taken to Spain at the end of the
fifteenth or sixteenth year at national expense, and there educated at
the expense of the Manila treasury in whatever profession they choose.
These shall reside in the Peninsula thereafter, where they shall be
given a post. Some few of the thirty or so of the males reaching the
indicated age annually, will doubtless prefer to devote themselves to
commerce or industry; hence at the most there will be only about
twenty-five passages of young men to reckon on annually, which will be
an inconsiderable expense. If this plan be carried out there will be
few children to transport after sixteen years. European Spaniards, if
prohibited from marrying native Filipino and mestizo women, will marry
only Filipino-Spanish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36"
name="pb36">36</a>]</span>women. Hence, as they continue to retire to
Spain, the white population will constantly decrease. There will not be
a sufficiently large number of whites to become turbulent, and the
domination of the Peninsula over the islands will be ensured. This plan
can be carried out at an annual expense of about 40,000 pesos, and
probably much less. This will really be a saving over present expenses,
for retirement and widows&rsquo; pensions cost more, the widow of an
oidor receiving 18,000 reals vellon. Hence, the passive classes receive
about 175,000 pesos annually. However, Mas does not advocate that those
receiving pensions at present be deprived of them or sent to Spain, as
this would be unjust and cause discontent. In former years the quarrels
and discontent did not lead to desire for independence. The population
was not so great as now; also (and especially) since an annual situado
was sent from the Peninsula to pay the government employes, and the
latter thus depended on the Spanish treasury, they would have gained
nothing by rebelling. This is the case at present in the Marianas
Islands, where the officials are paid and supported from the money and
food sent there, and the few whites there, consequently, have no desire
for independence.] It will also be asked, in addition, whether, in case
the Philippine colony separated at present, it would be possible for
the white population to become masters of the country, or would there
be a tendency for them, perhaps, to amalgamate with the colored
population. The observation is very just. The Filipino-Spaniards do not
think of forming a body with the (Indian) natives, nor is it possible
for them to desire it, for now they are the masters and in such an
event they would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>become equals and even inferiors, since the vast
mass of the natives would quickly reduce them to nullity in the matter
of government, and in place of the privileges and exemptions from
paying taxes, which they at present enjoy, they would more than once
have to obey and humble themselves before the very one who now mops the
ground that their foot touches. In the recent occurrence of
Tayabas,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1007src" href="#xd27e1007" name=
"xd27e1007src">8</a> when the first news of the insurrection arrived, I
was at a gathering of several Spanish leaders, and they all believed,
or at least suspected, that the whites of the country had compromised
themselves in the matter. I maintained immediately, and obstinately,
that they were mistaken in this, since however disloyal and intemperate
one may fancy the Filipino-Spaniards, it was impossible for me to
believe that it would ever enter their heads to arouse and arm the
natives. In fact, the true spirit of the movement was soon known, and
it was seen that the Filipino-Spaniards were as alarmed at the result
(if not more so) as were the Europeans. Their hopes and plans, then,
can only be based on the persuasion that the natives and Chinese
mestizos will continue quiet, and pay the tribute as at present, and
that they will make their patrimony from the country, and share its
posts. This idea is highly absurd, no doubt. Much less loved by the
natives than the Europeans, without the support of the friars (for even
granting the case that those living in the country should remain,
others would cease to go from the Peninsula), without capital, in a
weak minority for the subjugation of more than two hundred thousand
rich, active, and intelligent mestizos, and three and one-half millions
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>natives (who have already rebelled against the
Spaniards themselves, in spite of the great prestige of the
reenforcements that could be received from the other side of the seas),
and compelled by force of circumstances to adopt a liberal and
intelligent system with reference to these same natives, which would
speedily make the latter more arrogant and exacting than at present, it
is quite easy to see that the government of Filipinas, would within a
very few years, fall into the hands of the Indian Filipinos, or,
perhaps, into those of the Chinese mestizos, or of the two races mixed,
and that the whites would become submissive to the people of
color&mdash;if they were not despoiled of all their property, as having
been usurped and without valid title, just as happened to the Turkish
families who had acquired possession in that land during the long rule
of the Turks in Greece, in which, since the insurrection, not a single
Mussulman has remained. It is clear, therefore, that this Spanish
population, long established in the country, is the one that has most
to lose. In case of an outbreak, the Europeans would return to
Espa&ntilde;a, where they would continue their professions and would
find their kin. The Filipino-Spaniards, however, would have to change
utterly, for they would lose everything, and would have to seek another
country. These are obvious and important truths, and nevertheless, can
we tax the individuals in question with being blind or stupid, when we
see repeatedly in the history of popular revolts that a Bailly, a
Danton, in fine, that the most clever and eminent men persuade
themselves that they are able to stop a revolution at the line which
they trace, and do not suspect that they are going to be the victims of
the masses who rise?</p>

<p>For the white population that remains in the country, and for all
who are living there at present, agriculture offers an abundant
resource. Very fatal is the deep-rooted idea that Spaniards cannot
prosper in it. [Mas cites several instances to prove that Spaniards can
succeed in agriculture in the Philippines. He also cites the instances
of the Ansaldos family as told by father Agustin de Santa Maria, who
acquired great wealth from agriculture, and who moved to the Peninsula
during the English invasion.] Reflection: Just as the two Ansaldos
brothers, leaving the life of trade, which the Spaniards in the Indias
generally follow, applied themselves to the cultivation of the soil
through their own efforts, lived many years, and succeeded in amassing
a fixed and permanent capital, why could not the same be done by so
many idle spongers who go about Manila with their white faces begging,
deceiving, terrifying, exciting, and confounding all the
inhabitants?</p>
<p>The present superintendent of the islands, Don Juan M. de la
Matta,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1031src" href="#xd27e1031" name=
"xd27e1031src">9</a> whose opinion I greatly respect, because I truly
believe that he is one of the few Spaniards who know the country, and
that he has the capacity, honor, patriotism, and energy to do something
good and solid there, wrote me in a letter now before me: &ldquo;It is
necessary for the Spanish population to stick to agriculture, the only
source capable of providing abundantly for their necessities, for which
the profit from any other employ in the different careers of the state
is indeed very insufficient. I have already called the attention of the
ministry of the treasury to this particular, showing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>that a
wretched generation, and consequently, one dissolute and turbulent, is
increasing daily, and that the government must prevent in time the
fatal consequences, by inviting them to turn their attention to
agriculture.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1039src" href="#xd27e1039"
name="xd27e1039src">10</a> In fact, there are rich and extensive lands
which have been abandoned, which ought to invite the attention of a
Filipino-Spaniard more than the posts, for with an estate not only can
he live in ease and independently, but he can also establish a rich
patrimony for his descendants. Lands that now are worth little, or even
nothing, will in time have a greater or less price by reason of the
population of the territory and the perfection to which its cultivation
is carried. There is today in the charity hospital of Sidney an aged
woman, whose husband owned a bit of land, which he sold thirty years
back for three pounds sterling, and at this moment it is worth one-half
million pesos fuertes. And this, only because of the rapid increase in
population! In Filipinas itself, any one can be convinced of this
manifest fact, which is a trivial truth among economists. In Laguna and
other provinces, there are most fertile fields, abandoned and at the
disposal of the one who will take them; and in Bulacan and Tondo, whose
soil is very inferior, all have owners and a value. In the environs of
Malolos and Manila, land costs one thousand <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>pesos
fuertes per qui&ntilde;on. One hundred years ago, this same
qui&ntilde;on could be bought for fifty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[The difficulty in attracting the whites to an agricultural life
lies in the labor question. Mas does not consider advisable the system
of the Dutch in Java,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1046src" href=
"#xd27e1046" name="xd27e1046src">11</a> and prescribed by certain laws
of the Indies, of compelling the natives to work in estates at the
established wage scale, &ldquo;as the natives have been accustomed for
three centuries to be humored and allowed freely to work or live in
idleness according to their fancy.&rdquo; He proposes that the heavy
tribute of the Chinese who cultivate the lands of the Spaniards be
reduced to the small amount paid by the Chinese mestizos; also that
negritos, Igorots, and captured Moro pirates be made to cultivate the
fields for the Spaniards. He also recommends the plan of indenturing
the condemned criminals out to the cultivators, as England did with its
criminals, who were sent to America in former periods. This system Mas
does not consider as unjust or inhumane, but quite the contrary, for
the farmers, since their pocket book is touched, will be more
considerate than the prison officials. He recommends the awarding of
prizes for the cultivation of cacao and coffee; and &ldquo;finally, the
authorization of individual contracts, by means of which Filipinos may
bind themselves to work on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href=
"#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>the estate of a Spaniard for a
certain number of years, as is done in the military service, such
Spaniards then remaining subject until the termination of the contract.
These persons, during said time, shall be exempt from service in the
army, and exemption from polos and personal service may even be
conceded to some (for instance, to one for each qui&ntilde;on of
land).&rdquo;]</p>
<p>2d. People of color must voluntarily respect and obey the whites. In
order to attain this object, it is necessary to maintain the former
race in an intellectual and moral condition which will make of their
numerical majority a political force less than that which resides in
the second, just as a pile of straw in the balance weighs less than a
gold nugget. The farmer or the goatherd does not read social contracts,
or know more than what takes place in his own village. This is not the
class of people who have overthrown absolutism in Espa&ntilde;a, but
that class who are educated in the colleges, and who know the price of
guarantees, and fight for them. We must not depart from this point of
view, if we are to discuss the matter sincerely. The making of liberals
must be necessarily avoided, for in a colony the words liberal and
insurgent are synonymous. The consequence of the idea will be to admit
the principle that each step forward is a treading backward. It is
necessary to circumscribe the education to primary schools where
reading, writing, and arithmetic will be taught, continuing as at
present with one school in each village, and leaving their direction to
the curas. The colleges for males now existing in Manila must be
closed.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1072src" href="#xd27e1072" name=
"xd27e1072src">12</a> In English India, whose educational institutions
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>and free government are of so much weight with
some, there is nothing similar to this, and an Englishman who wishes to
become a lawyer, a notary, a physician, or a military or civil
official, has to go to England for study and graduation&mdash;I say
Englishman, for the natives do not even enter into the question.</p>
<p>In the service of arms, they must not rise beyond privates or at the
most corporals. It is much better to make a sergeant or officer from a
Spanish farmer, even though he cannot read and write, than from the
more capable native. On the contrary, the more dexterous and deserving
is the latter, so much greater will be the mistake committed. Here the
one who plays for gain loses. It is less dangerous and more tolerable
to bestow the rank of officer on a very stupid, vicious, and cowardly
fellow.</p>
<p>It is necessary to provide that a Spanish cura be placed in each
village, and it is preferable to leave a village without a minister
rather than to place it in charge of a Filipino secular priest. Between
Filipinas and Espa&ntilde;a there is no other bond of union than the
Christian religion. This bond is very powerful, and may induce the
islanders to love and to defend the Spanish domination as a duty. In no
place better than in Espa&ntilde;a is it known of what the religious
influence on the masses is capable, even in violation of their most
direct interests. To imagine that the natives will become fond of our
government because they judge it good or the best possible, I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>believe a vain project. Their ignorance regarding
the condition of other peoples does not permit of their entering into
such comparisons; and those who might be capable of doing it, will
discuss political matters; and however excellent such men consider our
domination, they would always think that it would be more advantageous
for them to withdraw from the yoke and seize the scepter in their own
hands, and pass by this method from their humble condition of vassals
and subjugated to that of masters and mandarins. Therefore, just as the
community is sustained by virtue and the monarchy by fidelity, this
colony, in my opinion, must be maintained by religion. Starting from
this beginning, nothing can become so direct an agent for promoting
emancipation, as the ordaining of priests among the natives.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1085src" href="#xd27e1085" name=
"xd27e1085src">13</a> Some persons observe that they are unfit and
vicious, and consequently, do not infuse respect, exercise influence or
cause fear. More, if a Filipino secular priest lives in a state of
intoxication, and even commits, as has indeed happened, atrocious
crimes which lead him to the scaffold, he does not for this cease to be
a priest; and thus he degrades the class to which he belongs, and
undermines the prestige of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>sanctity surrounding the character of
a religious man. And this idea, namely, that because they are
Filipinos, they cannot have any influence, has been destroyed by merely
the recent insurrection in Tayabas, where a lay-brother, a young
fellow, without any personal or antecedent quality that could make him
respected, was able, by means of a religious matter&mdash;without the
printed copies of the admonition of the archbishop of Manila, or the
Spanish friars of the neighboring territory, being able to prevent
it&mdash;to cause a settlement to mutiny and to arm a crowd of three or
four thousand men, even to the point of firing upon their own pastors,
who only saved themselves by means of flight; to kill the governor of
the province; and attack the national troops. And so that my opinion in
regard to this matter is, and has been, that of many others who studied
the country, I shall copy a few extracts illustrative of the
matter.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1093src" href="#xd27e1093" name=
"xd27e1093src">14</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>[Mas&rsquo;s first extract is from a communication to the king from
Governor Aguilar, dated November 25, 1804. In this letter, Aguilar
characterizes the native secular priests as lazy and dissolute. He
cites a recent example of a village, evidently previously in charge of
the native seculars, where a Recollect priest has been placed in
charge, and where in consequence the church has been completed and
order preserved. Although there are some good native priests, they do
not infuse the respect that the regulars do, for the latter are never
intimate with their parishioners, while the native priests, on the
other hand, live on an intimate footing with them, and enter into every
detail of their lives. Consequently, the regulars can manage the
natives better than the native secular priests. Again the religious
have no ties, and hence their only care is their church and their duty.
The native seculars are burdened with relatives, who even live in the
curacies with them, and hence, they neglect their churches which soon
fall into ruin. It would be bad indeed for the islands if the bishops
were to transfer the curacies to the native seculars. That might be
done when there are Spanish secular priests who possess the right
qualities, but to transfer them to the natives would be committing a
great wrong. If all the villages in charge of native secular priests
had friar curas, they would be in a much better condition. In Negros,
which is in charge of the native seculars, nothing is done, a ruinous
condition prevails, and the villages are greatly depopulated. If the
matter were left to him, he would not allow a single native secular
priest to have charge of a village. They might profitably be used as
assistants to the regulars.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>[The second letter is one from the Manila Ayuntamiento, dated July
12, 1804. This letter is highly laudatory of the friars, who spare no
pains to fulfil their duties. The native secular priests however, are
only in few instances found efficient, and are in general only fit to
act as assistants to the friar curas. The Filipinos with their weak
intellects, seem unfitted for the office of priest, by reason of their
lack of constancy. They have not the education requisite for the office
of priest, for the conciliar seminaries are little more than a name in
which a few native secular priests, themselves without sufficient
education, attempt to teach. The regulars subjected to the royal
patronage would be much better than any native seculars. After Mindoro
was transferred from the Recollects to the native seculars, the
missions quickly declined, churches were ruined, Moro raids increased,
and the tribute of the villages fell off. In consequence, the
government now wishes to replace the native clergy by the Recollects.
The regulars also further the temporal affairs, and have done notable
things in agriculture. The Ayuntamiento hopes that the complaints
against the regulars will be disregarded, &ldquo;for although there are
some defects which they may have, they are always useful to religion
and the state.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>Taking the Christian religion as the foundation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>upon
which our domination is sustained, it is evident that everything that
contributes to destroy the religious spirit, destroys and undermines
this foundation. Under this idea nothing can have more direct harm than
the degradation and corruption of the minister of divine worship, and
experience has demonstrated this truth. For just as the first
sectarians of Jesus Christ extended his religion rapidly by means of
the enthusiasm which took possession of their minds, and by means of
the martyrdoms which they suffered, so also, in all places where the
priests have given themselves to effeminacy, to feasting, to ambition,
and to vices, the belief of the peoples has diminished from that
moment, and they have ended by falling into religious indifference. The
government ought, then, to consider the clergy as a power; and just as
great care is taken not to introduce insubordination and demoralization
into an army, so also the government ought to watch over the conduct of
the curas. Let them have all the influence possible over the village,
but let them always be Spanish Europeans, and allow them to feel no
other interest than Espa&ntilde;a. This is the vital question. If the
matter be considered under this point of view, one cannot exaggerate
the harm that a goodly portion of the friars are doing, and the moral
force that our government is losing because of the manner in which they
are living. The most general weakness is that of concubinage. Many keep
a mistress (who is there called a stewardess [<i lang=
"es">despensera</i>]), inside or outside the convent. The convent in
Filipinas has no cloister, as it is a parochial house. And this fault,
if one considers the climate of the country, the circumstances, and the
ideas of the natives, is, to say truth, the most excusable and the
least harmful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>The most pernicious and transcendental fault into which many curas
have fallen especially for some time back&mdash;a fault ten times more
harmful than the one to which we have referred&mdash;is that of
avarice, fed by the practice of trading. It is well known that the mode
of trading in that country usually consists in usury, that is, in
advancing money in order later to receive products in kind at a very
low price. And even leaving aside this aspect of the matter, it
happens, as is natural, that the minister, as soon as he has become a
speculator, contrives to get some profit from his position, and from
the influence which his ministry and the policy indispensable in that
country give him, and thinks little or nothing of the means so long as
they conduce to the increase of his capital. Sometimes this vice is
united with the first, and the stewardess or her husband&mdash;who is
generally one of the servants of the convent, whom the friar has
married to her, in order to save appearances&mdash;is charged with the
gathering, magazines, shops, sales, etc. But it must be confessed that
the government has had a great part in this corruption, by protecting
the religious against their superiors. Two left during the term of
General Lardizabal, taking a large amount with them. When the
Augustinian provincial, Father Grijalvo, went with his secretary,
Father Fausto Lopez, to see him [<i>i.e.</i>, Lardizabal] about one of
them (Father Jarava)<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1126src" href=
"#xd27e1126" name="xd27e1126src">16</a> who wished to go away with his
money, and said provincial asserted to him that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>this was
a very bad example, as there were many who would devote their energies
to making money, and then leave, although religious are so necessary in
these islands, the said general answered him: &ldquo;Do not believe it.
You are not so necessary. You are deceived in this. The English
government in India has no friars, and yet that country is sustained
and prospers.&rdquo; Nevertheless, in Singapor, he [<i>i.e.</i>, Father
Jarava] boasted in conversation with the good Bishop Courvery (as the
latter mentioned to me) of the gold which he carried; and told him of
the presents which he had had to bestow in Manila in order to obtain
his passport, especially to the assessor of the government. The most
illustrious bishop wrote that to that capital, and on learning it, the
guileless general Lardizabal was angry enough to tear his hair, as was
mentioned by the secretary of the government, Cambronero.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1148src" href="#xd27e1148" name=
"xd27e1148src">17</a> In 1840 they went to inform the alcalde-mayor of
a province that all those who went away with indigo, unless provided
with a pass by the cura, were detained in the <i lang="tl">bantayan</i>
(a kind of sentry-box) of a village in his jurisdiction. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>The
alcalde ordered the matter to be investigated, and found it to be so;
and some passes were brought to him, which stated little more or less
than &ldquo;permit So-and-so to pass with so many quintals of
indigo.&rdquo; The reason for this was that the cura had advanced money
to them, and feared that if they carried away the indigo and sold it,
it would afterward be impossible to collect the money. The alcalde
ordered a verbal process to be formulated, in which two friars and two
secular priests made their depositions in the most effective terms
against the cura in question. [The alcalde-mayor wrote to the vicar of
the province, who answered him under date of Batac, July 25, 1840, to
the effect that the freedom given by the government to the friars, who
had been relieved of obedience to their prelates, accounted for this.
The government and the ideas of the present time were to blame,
consequently, not the friar prelates. The friar of whom the
alcalde-mayor and the vicar wrote boasted that when he was attacked on
the one side he took refuge in the jurisdiction of the other. Although
he boasted that he intended to take his 40,000 pesos and enjoy life
with a female companion, yet he obtained governmental permission to
remain in his curacy.] The curas generally suffer from another defect,
namely, that of meddling in temporal matters, or rather, of endeavoring
to abrogate all jurisdictions, and then assume these in themselves. It
is evident that there must be a limit to everything, and that those
friars who display an insolent spirit and are usurpers of command must
restrain themselves within limits. But this evil is one of the least,
if our chief and vital object be considered to be the conservation of
the state. Is it or not a fact that, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>for Espa&ntilde;a to
maintain this colony under its dominion, it needs the influence of the
religious over the inhabitants? If it is a fact, one must consider
these persons as instruments; their influence must be positive; the
alcaldes and other employes must be wheels of the machine, who must be
in communication with them, and to a certain point move at their
impulse. So long as the villages obey the voice of the friars, the
islands will be Spanish, for the friars can do no less than be so.
Emancipation would inevitably cause their ruin. This will appear hard
and unendurable to many who are not friends of theoretic intervention,
especially among the present military and civil officers of Filipinas;
but I understand it in this way, and do not see by what other agency a
handful of Spaniards can, at six thousand leguas&rsquo; distance, and
without Spanish troops, keep obedient a vast and wealthy country, which
has need of us for nothing, in which there are not a few elements of
independence, and which is coveted by many foreign nations.</p>
<p>And if all this is a fact, we can do no less than lament the
unjustifiable imprudence of having printed in the ordinances of good
government now in force, which were printed and distributed throughout
the whole country, the following:</p>
<p>[Here follow ordinances 17, 18, 24, 30, 31, 85, 87, 89, 91 and 92
(some only in part), for a synopsis of which see <span class="sc">VOL.
I.</span>, pp. 234, 235, 236, 238, 239, and 256&ndash;261. Mas
continues:]</p>
<p>In no part did the animosity with which these ordinances were
written appear so much as in these last two articles, for they treat of
the construction of convents, churches, and royal houses; and since
none <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>of these edifices can be erected without the
instructions of a special measure and by authorization, it follows that
the government is dictating provisions to itself, and consequently, it
was quite useless to insert them in a public law; and although it was
intended that they should contain the expression of the royal will, the
latter would always have been sufficient provided that action were
taken in the proper bureau. Moreover, what ordinance 91 says about the
possibility of the sumptuous convents being used as a shelter by the
enemy, as was experienced in the war with the English, seems to me to
be lacking in common sense. For if they are susceptible of being used
as fortresses, they will be an advantage to those possessing them, who
may, if they wish, burn them when they have to abandon them. In the
same category are all the strongholds. For example, in the war with the
English above mentioned, the latter captured Manila, and immediately
made use of the forts to protect themselves from Anda&rsquo;s troops.
Consequently, according to the argument, the fortifications of Manila
ought to be demolished. If the enemy defend themselves in the convents,
it will be because they have to flee from us, and then we can desire
nothing better than that they shut themselves up, so that we may
surround them and take them prisoners. If the Spaniards are in such a
condition that they look upon the convent as a refuge, they can, since
they are in their own country, get aid at any moment. A large and
beautiful church, in the midst of a village of bamboo or board houses,
contributes not a little to inspire a lofty idea of what is within it.
All the sumptuous edifices of the ancients were temples. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>The utility of protecting the religious spirit having been admitted,
the Spaniards of the province, who in general give a contrary example,
by not fulfilling their church duties, do great harm. This is so much
more harmful, as they are in the sight of the entire village, which
knows quite well the actions of their most private life. Finding myself
on the day of Corpus Christi at a place where a large procession and
Church function were being made, not a single Spaniard of the several
who were there, went to mass, including the governor of the province.
For an alcalde not to go to mass, becomes so much the more scandalous,
as it is the custom for the gobernadorcillo with all the community and
past captains to go to get him at the royal house in order to accompany
him as a matter of ceremony to the church.</p>
<p>It happens on account of this that it is enough for them to give
notice of a Spaniard to the cura so that the latter may have the cura
told that he is not at home&mdash;a thing which contributes to destroy
the prestige of our name and dominion. Surely, this, joined with other
motives, has contributed to diminish the spirit of devotion, especially
for the last fifteen or twenty years. This decrease is not imaginary. I
have assured myself of it through several channels, among others,
through a house that formerly traded in books of religion and prints.
From this I deduce that our foundations are becoming weaker, and if
they are not strengthened, it may be delayed more or less, but the
edifice will fall. I opine then, that if the colony is to be conserved,
it is absolutely necessary to take positive measures to check the
exterior manifestations of irreligion; to cause the priests to appear
under the most possible venerable point of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>view;
and to endeavor to have their influence over the masses powerful. One
of the acts to which the curas now see themselves obliged, and which
robs them of great prestige, is the collection of the parochial fees at
marriages and burials. A person who has lost a child or a parent by
death, has in addition to the grief for his loss, the expense which it
occasions. He goes to the cura weeping, and tells him that he has no
money. The cura, nevertheless, must show himself inexorable; finally
the native hands the cura a portion of the sum; the parish priest bids
him go get the part lacking; he returns with another portion; and after
seeing that the pretense of his poverty avails him nothing, he pays the
whole fee. There are some who come with the money divided into the four
corners of their handkerchiefs, and unwrap them one after the other,
trying each time to avoid the payment. The same thing happens in
marriages; and there are many who live in concubinage waiting until the
cura marries them free of charge. These scenes are very unpleasant to
the religious, and yet, they can do no less than show themselves hard,
for if they did otherwise they would be unable to collect any of the
fees which belong to them and form the greater part of their income.
And the worst of all is, that this money which the cura would lose,
would probably not be used in reproductive investments, but would be
spent in feasting and the cockpit. It would be, then, much more
advisable, and very much to the taste of the religious, to have a
general tax imposed, and collected by the alcalde, as now happens with
the <i lang="la">sanctorum</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1184src"
href="#xd27e1184" name="xd27e1184src">18</a> One-half real <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>annually
for each soul would be sufficient and would compensate, as some of them
have assured me, for the present sum of the parochial fees. The display
in the ceremony of marriage and burial ought to be suitable and
designated by rules. Those who desired <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>any music or some
extraordinary mourning decorations could pay something extra. In that
way, the parishioners would experience nothing more from their parish
priests than agreeable things&mdash;counsel, protection, and alms.</p>
<p>Since it is very important that the religious, as guides of public
opinion, have essentially Spanish hearts, it is absolutely necessary
for all these men to be born, to have been educated and ordained in
Espa&ntilde;a. From this is deduced the need of protecting the colleges
existing at present, and where friars are made who take a vow for
Filipinas.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1237src" href="#xd27e1237" name=
"xd27e1237src">19</a></p>
<p>Their pride must be entirely broken, and they must in all places and
on all occasions consider the Spaniard as their master, and not their
equal. Our laws of Indias, dictated in the most beneficent, but not
always in the most wise, spirit, not only concede them all the rights
of Spaniards, but seem in several points to prefer them to the
Spaniards, especially in the possession of lands. These benevolent
regulations, often executed with exaggeration by the auditors of the
Audiencia, the protector of the Indians, and the governors-general who
come from Espa&ntilde;a, overflowing with ideas of philanthropy and
humanity, and without knowing the natives otherwise than by their
humble hypocritical exterior with influential persons, have raised
their pretensions to an alarming degree.</p>
<p>[The natives have committed many acts of violence and contempt. A
Recollect cura was beheaded in Talibong, Ceb&uacute;; the provincial
governor of Negros was assassinated in 1833, and another Spaniard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>severely wounded; the alcalde-mayor of Capis was
attacked in 1836, but saved himself by his presence of mind; the house
of the alcalde-mayor of Antique was burned and he barely escaped the
flames; another alcalde-mayor was taken prisoner to Manila in an iron
cage; the cura and government employes were ridiculed in pantomimic
dances in Capan in 1841; a comedy was to have been enacted at the
feast-day celebrations at Santa Cruz, Laguna, in 1840, in which the
alcalde-mayor and his court were to be held up to ridicule, but it was
avoided by the arrest of the actors. It has happened sometimes that the
gobernadorcillo remains seated in the presence of a Spaniard with whom
he has contests in the ayuntamiento. The members of the village
ayuntamientos are not accustomed to rise when a Spaniard enters the
town hall, and even laugh at them; and should the Spaniard grow angry
and strike any of them, complaint is forthwith made to the governor,
who punishes the Spaniard. An artillery captain and an advocate were
stoned without cause in a Laguna village. A Spaniard, angered by the
insolent answer of a native, struck him, whereupon the native
threatened his life. In Manila, the natives are insolent. They do not
yield the sidewalk to Spaniards; coachmen and porters do not rise in
the presence of Spaniards; Filipino women do not yield to Spanish women
either in the stores or the church. Since the new governor,
Ora&aacute;, has ordered a verbal process against a commandant for
punishing a servant, they have become more insolent than ever. Other
acts of insolence are noted. These things are not heard of by the
governor, or they lay no stress upon them as they do not recognize
their political importance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href=
"#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>&ldquo;Before the justice, the
Spaniards and the Filipinos are equal.&rdquo; The latter, however, get
better treatment from the governors, who have even punished provincial
governors severely, while they have treated the natives with clemency.
The prestige of the Spanish name must be preserved. &ldquo;He who
merits it must without doubt be punished, not only for the crime which
he commits against humanity and justice, but also because it obscures
the luster of the Spanish character from which righteousness,
benevolence, and liberality ought always shine forth. But it is
advisable that this be among Spaniards, and that no account or
satisfaction of it be given to the natives. Place them in the way of
rights, and they will not pay until driving us from their soil.&rdquo;
It is wrong to treat the native with less severity than the Spaniard.
Mas asserts that in all the countries in which he has traveled, he has
had to exercise patience to no greater degree than in the Philippines.
The insolence and disrespect which he has witnessed do not allow him to
see safety and security for the Spaniards. &ldquo;It seems to me that
the islands were more secure in the times when a native got down on his
knees when a Spaniard passed.&rdquo; Mas advises that Spaniards alone
be allowed to wear the neckerchief, and that natives and mestizos be
distinguished by the loose shirt and straw hat which they have chosen
themselves. Principales only should be permitted to wear jackets. The
religious have destroyed distinction in rank among the natives in great
measure, but while this is generous and democratic, &ldquo;the
destruction of rank also destroys the principle of ambition, the
stimulus for economy and work.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>The places of cabezas de barangay must not be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>hereditary, but these posts ought to be filled by
the most wealthy. Among these people aristocracy of money has great
influence, but not that of family. In the colony, there must be no
noble blood except the Spanish. When the Filipino or mestizo meets a
Spaniard, the former shall be obliged to stop (except at Manila) to
salute him. If seated, he shall rise when the Spaniard addresses him or
passes in front of him. He who raises his hand against a Spaniard,
although it be to defend his own life, shall incur the penalty of
laboring on the public works all his life. If the offense is verbal,
the punishment shall be decreased in proportion to the case. A Spaniard
shall not give a seat in his house to a Filipino or mestizo, much less
sit at table with him. He who falls into this fault of decorum, shall
be punished the first two times by a fine, and the third time he shall
be exiled from the colony. No Spaniard, under any consideration, shall
be allowed to contract marriage with any Filipino or mestizo woman. The
Filipinos or mestizos who desire to use a carriage or a saddle horse,
shall have to obtain a permit for which an annual tax shall be charged,
so that those who sustain this luxury may be very few. [Mas condemns
the custom of giving the title &ldquo;Don&rdquo; to gobernadorcillos
and principales. Even almost naked Tinguianes and Igorots are found
with that title&mdash;which is ridiculous. Let the Filipinos use their
own native equivalents for &ldquo;Don&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a.&rdquo; Also the natives should not be allowed to
present petitions which are disrespectful because of their ignorance of
the language, such as for instance calling the governor a robber.]</p>
<p>Government employes should be well paid, for in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>a
country where appearances count for so much as in the Philippines, it
is not well to live in a miserly manner. There are no Spanish grandees
in the colony, and but few of the merchants can afford to live
luxuriously. Mere living expenses are cheaper than in Spain, and one
could if he desired save more, but if the natives live better than the
ruling class, there will be a loss of prestige. Better salaries are
paid in the Philippines than in Spain, but this is necessary. The
governor, for instance, must really give some idea of the royal master
whom he is serving, and this can be done through a certain amount of
display. Each official ought to spend at least two-thirds of his
pay.</p>
<p>No Spaniard ought to be allowed to go to the provinces who is not of
well-known good behavior, and who does not leave in Manila a bondsman
for the debts which he may contract. Passports are at times given to
poor Spaniards, soldiers, or licensed corporals, for example, who go
through the villages of the interior defrauding, guzzling, entering the
houses of the town in an unbecoming manner, asking perhaps, food or
baggage without paying for them, and finally obliging the natives to
arrest them. The pernicious consequences of these examples are
incalculable.</p>
<p>[In case that the employes of the treasury are decreased in number,
and collections are made by contractors, only natives and Chinese
mestizos should be accepted as such, on account of the odium incurred.
The latter class will probably take the contract, which will result in
good as it will tend to develop race hatred between them and the
Filipinos.]</p>
<p>Those races are the ones who make up the population. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>The one
excels and is strong through its number, and the other through its
intelligence, activity, and wealth. The ability of the government will
consist in keeping them always separated, and at swords&rsquo; points,
in order that they may never form a common mass or public spirit, but
that, on the contrary, the one may serve as an instrument to subject
the other. Filipinos would rather associate with mestizos than with
Spaniards, for although the first tyrannize over them, and draw them
under the yoke so far as possible, they invite them to dine, and treat
them so that they all appear united. The Spaniards, for the most part,
always talk to them with an air of superiority, and keep them at a
certain distance&mdash;a thing which naturally disgusts the
Filipino.</p>
<p>[The Filipinos do not, however, like the Chinese any better, but on
the contrary, respect the Spaniards more as coming from a higher race.
They regard the mestizos as a bastard race and beneath themselves.
There are many lawsuits between the two classes for preference in rank.
In villages where there are both mestizos and natives, each class has
its own gobernadorcillo, although that of the latter has now been
declared superior in rank, and in case of the death or absence of the
alcalde-mayor, takes his place. They are jealous of these privileges,
and in case of immediate separation, the mestizos would not become the
dominant force in the country. This rivalry is useful for Spanish
interests and must be preserved. The Chinese mestizos will within a
century have grown to at least one million by natural increase and
immigration from China; and will possess the greater part of the wealth
of the islands. They are the proprietors, merchants, and educated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>people of the country, and will dominate public
opinion. This class has no sympathy for Spain and will be difficult to
subdue. Therefore, the moral force of the natives must be preserved,
and the rivalry between the two classes fomented, so that the natives
may not become the vassals of the mestizos. Mas proposes a land tax on
the mestizos and a distinctive dress. Theaters for both natives and
mestizos, where they can rival and ridicule each other will be helpful.
Arts and the prosperity of the country must be stimulated, for if the
natives are left to their natural incapacity and sloth, they will be in
the power of the Chinese mestizos within a century.]</p>
<p>[A Spanish force of at least one thousand or five hundred men is
needed. If the native soldiers mutiny, nothing can restore discipline
unless there is a Spanish force. Some of the governors have opposed
even Spanish corporals and sergeants. The country seems quiet but a
terrible mutiny and revolt may occur any day. There were only Spanish
soldiers in the old days, and respect was more manifest. Native
regiments are of modern date. The disreputable regiment of Asia made up
largely of criminals has caused the Spanish soldiers to lose prestige
among the natives. And besides they have been wretchedly treated. It
would be well to have soldiers from Borneo or other islands outside the
archipelago. If the British do not object, men might even be enlisted
cheaply in India. This would relieve the natives from service, from
which they would gladly be free; and the country would be more secure,
and more prosperous.]</p>
<p>[The principales should be allowed to hold meetings <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>only in
the presence of the cura. It is well known that they plot against the
alcalde-mayor and the cura at times when they assemble for any common
matter.]</p>
<p>The Spanish language ought not to be taught them, but they ought to
learn to read and write in their own. It is impossible to avoid the
introduction of papers and books into the provinces which it is
unadvisable for them to read, and experience demonstrates that those
who know our language, are almost always the restless ones of the
villages and those who murmur at, censure, and act contrary to the
curas and alcaldes.</p>
<p>[It is folly to teach the natives how to make artillery and
firearms. Factories for the manufacture of these are now being finished
in the islands. It would be better to send everything of this nature
from Spain. Another imprudence is the manufacture of powder. Besides
its inferiority to Spanish powder, and the danger of allowing the
natives to learn to make it, it costs more than that sent from Spain.
Although after the delivery of twelve thousand quintals, the factory
and its effects are to become national property, the works which are
now not worth more than ten thousand pesos, will be worthless.]</p>
<p>[Mas recommends the use of steam vessels for inter-island
communication, for the rapid moving of troops, and the better
protection of Spanish interests. They can also be used against the
Moros<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1281src" href="#xd27e1281" name=
"xd27e1281src">20</a> with better effect than the small squadron of
sailing vessels now employed, and will be more economical. Coal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>and wood abound in the islands and can be used as
fuel.]</p>
<p>The publication of a newspaper shall be permitted under the
supervision of the government. In them shall be inserted descriptions
of the best methods of making sugar, indigo, etc., dyeing thread,
tempering iron, and in fact everything that may conduce to the
instruction of agriculture and manufacture; the edicts and orders of
the government; and political news, both peninsular and foreign, edited
in the manner that is found advisable. [All the village ayuntamientos
shall be compelled to subscribe to such a paper, and the cura shall be
asked to translate into the native vernacular all useful articles.
Foreign papers are admitted without any charge, and prove, instead of a
benefit, an injury, for they are all democratic in tone, and foment
disorder and discontent.] The non-existence of newspapers in Filipinas
causes a very bad result among foreigners, who consider them and with
reason, the foremost mark of civilization, and at the same time, the
government is deprived of the advantage of guiding public
opinion.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1288src" href="#xd27e1288" name=
"xd27e1288src">21</a></p>
<p>A system of police must be established, especially in the capital.
Not many years ago, there was a commission of public vigilance, which
was abolished, I believe, during the government of General Camba. The
neglect of the captains-general in this regard at present is scarce
credible.</p>
<p>[Although China has caused and will cause trouble in the future,
still the salutary punishments that the Chinese have received, and the
rapid increase in the Filipino population, justify the admission
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>into the islands of 15,000 or 20,000 more Chinese,
on the basis that there are only 8,000 or 10,000 now in the islands.
These can be scattered through the islands and would work only on the
estates of Spaniards.] Twenty thousand Chinese could work 10,000
qui&ntilde;ons of land, which planted with sugar cane would yield
annually 2,000,000 picos of sugar. This sugar sold at Manila at only 3
pesos fuertes [per quintal] would produce the sum of 6,000,000 pesos
fuertes. [In case of a popular insurrection the Chinese would all side
with the government and if an attack were threatened from China, it
would be sufficient to turn them over to the Filipinos, who, because of
their hatred for them, on account of their superior industry, would
soon make short work of them.]</p>
<p>[Foreigners are useful because of their knowledge and capital, and
create much wealth for the islands through their continued traffic with
their own countries. But their presence does not promote the
conservation of the colony.] Formerly the feeling against this class of
persons was very pronounced, owing in great measure to the religious,
who always spoke of the English, Dutch, etc., as heretics, drunkards,
and barbarians. The antipathy thus engendered was highly important, in
case of an outside attack. [The natives are now friendly to foreigners,
who pay more liberally than Spaniards, and even Spaniards at Manila are
aping the English and are friendly to them. Undesirable books have and
will surely be introduced through the foreigners; and consequently, the
laws forbidding them to go to the provinces must be enforced, and
entrance to Manila must not be easy. La Place, the Frenchman, although
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>he wrote many inaccurate things of the
islands,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1305src" href="#xd27e1305" name=
"xd27e1305src">22</a> recognized the danger from foreigners, when
speaking of the slaughter of the foreigners in 1819 during the
cholera.]</p>
<p>3rd. The administration requires a complete reform. The command of
Filipinas has always been entrusted to a governor and captain-general,
as if it were a province of Espa&ntilde;a. To set some balance to his
power, because of the distance from the throne, certain privileges and
preeminences have been granted to other persons, especially to the
Audiencia, even to the point of making of the latter a court of appeal
against the measures of the chief of the islands. Besides, the revenues
have been removed from his jurisdiction, and the office of the
intendant has been constituted, who obeys no others than the orders
communicated to him by the ministry of the treasury from
Madrid.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1319src" href="#xd27e1319" name=
"xd27e1319src">23</a> It is very obvious that this single point is
quite sufficient to paralyze completely the action of the
governor-general. Besides, since there are many matters which require
to be passed on by distinct ministries, it happens that two contrary
orders <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>touch the same matter, or that one order is
lacking, which is enough to render its execution impossible, the
contingency moreover arising that a chief may detain a communication,
even after he has received it, if it does not suit him. This system of
setting obstacles in the way of the governor of a distant colony is
wise and absolutely necessary, but since the <i lang="es">Leyes de
Indias</i> are not a constitutional code, but a compilation made in the
year 1754<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1332src" href="#xd27e1332" name=
"xd27e1332src">24</a> of royal orders despatched at various epochs and
by distinct monarchs, in which are decided points of government,
justice, war, politics, revenue, procedure, etc., there results rather
than a balance among the various departments of authority a confusion
of jurisdictions, the fatal fount of eternal discord. [Mas cites laws
from <i lang="es">Leyes de Indias</i> showing the great confusion and
contrariety of the orders to governor and Audiencia. This confusion has
given rise to scandalous and tragic events because of the contests over
authority. During these latter years have occurred many offenses of
like nature. General Enrile had them with the intendant, and General
Camba mentions several during the period of his government. To these
difficulties, is added another, in order that the chariot may run right
and easily; the government of the provinces is in charge of an
alcalde-mayor,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1342src" href="#xd27e1342"
name="xd27e1342src">25</a> who is at once judge of first instance,
chief of the political matters, subdelegate of the treasury, and war
captain or military commandant, for whose different attributes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>he is subject to authorities distinct from one
another. This appears inconceivable, but yet it is a fact, although the
cleverness of our India legislators has not been so great that it could
free the system of the inconveniences which necessarily must obstruct
it.</p>
<p>Whatever difficulty occurs in the fulfilment of an order, it must be
solved by means of a conference and advice [<i lang=
"es">consulta</i>],<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1355src" href=
"#xd27e1355" name="xd27e1355src">26</a> from which a reply is not
obtained until from twelve to fourteen months. These difficulties are
more frequent in Filipinas than in a province of the Peninsula, because
of the lack of knowledge of the country generally possessed by the
ministers who dictate the measures. Things have gone so far that it has
been ordered that the cultivation of the balate (a fish) be encouraged;
and that the situado of Zamboanga be sent overland, because of the loss
of the ship which was carrying it across to the island of Mindanao,
where D. Infantes was then governing said presidio. The superintendent
Enriquez says in the document which he printed on leaving his post in
1836,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1360src" href="#xd27e1360" name=
"xd27e1360src">27</a> that in the short period <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>in which
he filled the superintendency, he sent to the court six hundred and
twenty-seven questions for resolution. And to these springs of torpor
in the administration of the government, we must add that the
captains-general scarcely decide any question whatever, without handing
the matter for report to the assessor, fiscal, Audiencia, etc., because
of the distance and impossibility of consulting Espa&ntilde;a, and
through their fear of compromising themselves, since on many occasions,
measures have been obtained against them in Madrid, through agents and
representatives or through complaints sent from the islands. The same
thing happens with regard to the intendant and other authorities. From
this practice arises the system of expedientes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1374src" href="#xd27e1374" name="xd27e1374src">28</a> which
reigns, and which is so fatal to the prosperity and good government of
the country, since very often the arrangement that appears good to
some, is contrary to the opinions or interests of others. [Expedientes
lasting for years have been formulated for matters requiring immediate
attention. For instance, one lasting for years was formulated in regard
to an expedition against the Moro pirates. An expediente is formed when
a foreigner arrives at Manila without a passport from Spain and asks
permission to remain in the country, although the law on this point is
explicit. Thus much valuable time is lost and the expedientes result in
only a waste of paper, besides great injury to the islands. The
governor often has to conform to the opinions expressed in the
expediente, although he knows they will be the cause of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>injustice.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1382src"
href="#xd27e1382" name="xd27e1382src">29</a> On the other hand, the
governor is often directly at fault, because he enforces his own
opinion on his assessor, who has often obtained his position through
favoritism and is not a lawyer, and decides questions according to the
will of the governor. Besides, the governor has the armed force at his
disposal. The chiefs of the various departments at Manila carry on
correspondence with the directors-general of their respective
departments in Madrid, without the knowledge of the governor, a fact
that increases the confusion and disorder. The director of the mails
even is at fault in this, and renders accounts to the general
post-office department in Spain.] A sub-inspector of engineers newly
created, just went to Manila with orders to extend the fortifications
of the capital to its suburbs. The suburbs contain about fifty thousand
inhabitants scattered throughout various villages which are composed of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>houses all of one story in height, which is enough
to give an idea of the extension of the imagined fortification. The
amount of artillery for garrisoning their walls, the workshop necessary
to keep the artillery in good condition, the garrison necessary for
their defense, besides the operating gangs: all were to be in the
greatest magnitude, and demand an annual expense which the treasury of
the colony could not even remotely meet. And if one reflect that the
enemy can take all the other islands and even disembark at any point of
Luzon itself without the necessity of going to Manila; that if this
capital were besieged, it would be by enemies coming by sea, and hence,
being masters of the port, they would very quickly take by hunger a
place of one hundred and fifty thousand souls, or indeed it would be
surrendered by the natives, and then the inhabitants, instead of
contributing to the defense, would open their doors to the aggressors;
and that the concentration of the forces, the property, the archives,
and public and private wealth, at one single enclosed point, is to form
a target to call the attention of exterior and interior enemies: we can
do no less than agree that the plan of extending the fortifications of
Manila to all its suburbs lacks all reasonable foundation, and that it
will be advocated only by the many people who possess houses on the
shores of the Pasig River, within cannon range, because of their fear
lest, if the events of 1762 are again repeated, all those edifices
which they were by a fatal lack of foresight permitted to raise
successively (an evil which it is now very difficult if not impossible
to remedy), would be leveled to the ground.</p>
<p>[However, the present condition of the treasury <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>will not
allow this plan to be executed. The sub-inspector of the artillery has
petitioned that all companies of the regiment be commanded by captains
of the staff. This would cause discontent among the subalterns who
would see all hope of promotion vanish forever. They can rise now only
to captain, and some of them are even now angry. The artillery corps
has always been loyal to the government and it is advisable to keep it
so. Officers might indeed be trained in the military college, but in
that case the promotion of the sergeants must be arranged for.
Complaints of the military in the Philippines mean more than they do in
Spain where the complainers are retired or exercise patience. But this
substitution may be made without consulting the governor, as it is a
matter concerning the artillery itself.]</p>
<p>In the various departments of the administration there may also be
abuses to examine or correct, which will never be known or exactly
proved by chiefs resident in Madrid, because of the distance which is
so favorable to the distortion of facts. For example, the brigadier of
the navy, Don J. Ruiz de Apodaca, told me before the sub-inspector of
artillery and another chief that all the articles which were bought by
the treasury for the arsenal, were charged at a much higher price than
those for the fort, etc., and he invited me to go to his house where he
would prove it to me with the documents. On the other side, I have
heard complaints that after a contract had been made with the treasury
for cables, iron, etc., it is impossible to get a receipt for them in
the arsenal, unless for a bonus; that quantities of timber will not be
receipted for and those who have transported it to Cavite have to sell
it at any price; and that it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76"
href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>bought by the very ones who have
qualified it as useless; that many houses have been built in Cavite
with the timber given out as no good, only with the object of making
new bargains. Don F. Ossorio told me in the house of the secretary of
the government, and in the presence of several respectable persons,
that when he was commandant of artillery at that place, he made all the
furniture of his house with wood which he bought in the arsenal as
firewood. It is a fact that naval construction is very dear, and that
the fragata &ldquo;Esperanza&rdquo; cost more than 600,000 pesos
fuertes. During my stay in the islands, there has been talk of trickery
in the outlay of tobacco, besides a defalcation in the magazines of
three thousand eight hundred bundles of leaf. It was declared that
there was introduced, for example, into the factory magazines, a
quantity of bundled tobacco, in which was one part composed of fillers
[<i lang="es">palos</i>] which had to be burned as useless; but if
these fillers amounted to five thousand arrobas, only four thousand
were destroyed. The other thousand arrobas were taken out as leaf of
the best brand [from the magazines] and was carried to private houses
where it was manufactured as contraband. This leaf was replaced by the
fillers which ought to have been burned. For that reason, the cigars
which were sent to the tobacco shops of the provinces, and even those
which were sold to the trade, were sometimes of the worst quality; that
the boxes were short weight; that choice lots were finished with care,
and marked with a mark, and papers were given authorizing the exchange
of tobacco in the factory, by which means the associates in these
speculations could buy the poor tobacco which was given to the public,
and leave it in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"
name="pb77">77</a>]</span>national magazines, taking in place of it,
that manufactured properly and reserved. But what I know to be a
positive fact in this matter is that few or many superior or fine boxes
were made, which were obtained by favor in Manila; and that when Don
Luis Urrijola<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1400src" href="#xd27e1400"
name="xd27e1400src">30</a> left the intendancy, the tobacco had lost
its credit, and nine thousand boxes were held in the magazines, which
no merchant then or since has cared to buy. The new superintendent, Don
J. M. de la Matta took direct and positive measures by separating the
magazine from the factory, and reducing the functions of the latter to
the manufacture only, etc., whereupon the requests for the new tobacco
were renewed, so that when I left Manila, it was impossible by a great
amount to meet the demands of the trade. But had it not been for the
providential appointment to the superintendency of said clever and
zealous employe, perhaps that revenue would have entirely ceased. This
is one of the foremost resources of that country, and the
governor-general would at this moment find himself, perhaps, in the
greatest straits, and it would be impossible to prevent the evil,
although he knew its origin and progress, as he had no intervention in
the department of the treasury, which is, nevertheless, the soul of all
government. In the same place I also heard talk of the sale of posts,
of abuses in the pay of vouchers and other matters. [These things may
be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>misrepresentation or calumny, but they are ever
increasing in force and are being repeated with
exaggeration&mdash;which tends to weaken Spanish prestige which is the
source of their moral strength.]</p>
<p>I believe that all that I have observed is enough and more than
enough to show that the actual system of administration suffers from
capital defects, and to assert that, in my opinion, the organization of
a government is peremptory, which besides being a check on despotism
and a barrier to ambition, by means of correction and reform through
itself, contains the elements of unity, concord, prudence, rectitude,
power, and duration. Here follows for what it may be worth, a plan
circumscribed on fundamental bases.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1410src"
href="#xd27e1410" name="xd27e1410src">31</a></p>
<p>[Mas&rsquo;s plan provides for a regency or commission of three
persons, one of whom shall be the president and exercise the powers of
the governor-general. A fourth member is to be elected as a substitute
in case of death or illness, who, until called upon to fill any
vacancy, shall travel through the provinces and study the conditions of
the country. All matters of importance, especially money matters must
be decided at a meeting of the regency, and appear by an act signed by
all three. The president shall communicate and sign all orders, and all
official communications must be sent to him. The two secretaries,
political and military, shall receive orders only from the president,
and shall attend the meetings of the regency without vote. The
president alone shall decide questions of detail and procedure and
execution, in accordance with the regulations, always expressing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>whether any measure has been voted on or not. The
secretary shall send concise daily reports of all communications signed
during the day by the president, noting after each one whether it was
with or without the vote of the regency. Thus the other two regents
having it in their power to call for the rough draft of any measure,
can easily tell whether the president has overstepped his executory
powers and encroached on the powers of the entire regency. This
provision will obviate any such tendency on the president&rsquo;s part,
and will remove the jealousy of his two associates. The plan further
provides for a commander-in-chief of all the army; a commander of the
navy; a superintendent of the treasury; a court of justice; and a
Council of State, to be composed of the officials above mentioned,
together with the chiefs of artillery and fortification, the
contador-mayor of accounts, the contadors of the army and treasury, the
archbishop of Manila, and the provincials of the religious orders. The
Council which has no power to assemble of its own accord, shall be
assembled to consult on serious matters by the regency. At the death of
the president, the senior regent shall assume his office, the
substitute shall take a regular seat in the regency, and the Council
shall appoint a new substitute to act provisionally until the court
make a regular appointment, which shall never be the provisional
appointment of the Council. The deliberations of the Council shall be
secret and the regents shall only state the matters for discussion and
then retire. The Council may be assembled at the request of the regents
acting either singly or in accord. In impeachments of the president, if
the impeachment is sustained, the senior regent shall take <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>his
place; if it is not sustained, the Council shall retire, but may be
assembled any number of times for the same matter. There is a clause
against lobbying in the Council to influence the votes of the members.
In case of two summons at the same time, the Council shall obey the one
emanating from the president or senior regent first.]</p>
<p>The members of the regency shall be jurisconsults, owners of
estates, or military men, and the regularly-appointed president shall
always be a grandee of Espa&ntilde;a. It is highly important that, at
that distance, the first chief impose some personal respect, and that
even his very lineage make him appear superior to all the others.</p>
<p>[The dissension manifest in Basco&rsquo;s term as governor was due
to his low rank, as he was only a captain of fragata when he went to
the islands as governor, a fact that gave rise to envy. He was an
excellent governor, but the ministry that supported him did not know
the sentiments that move the human heart. Governor Lardizabal also was
of lower rank than some who served in subordinate positions in the
islands. It would be better to appoint a grandee to the post of
governor; for, having his estates in Spain, he would be more loyal. A
grandee also could better support the prestige of the government than a
poor soldier or man of no rank, as he would be more accustomed to the
duties of that life. A soldier generally desires to make money, and
will neglect his real duties. As a rule there are no battles to be
fought, while there are many duties of an administrational and
industrial character. The governor must have tact with the natives, and
look carefully after foreign, commercial, and industrial relations, and
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>progress of the islands. It would be highly
advisable to choose such a man when General Alcala is relieved.]</p>
<p>[For the government of the provinces, advocates shall be appointed
from Spain, and they shall remain no longer than twenty years in the
islands. There shall be three classes of provincial governments with
distinct salaries. In addition to the requisite number of provincial
governors there shall be six or eight substitutes in case of vacancies.
These shall receive a salary of fifty pesos per month, so long as they
are not called upon to fill a vacancy, and shall meanwhile do the
bidding of the regency. A vacancy in the governments of the first class
shall be filled by the regency from the governors of the second and
third classes; and one in the third class from the substitutes.
Governors may be transferred at will by the regency, and the relative
importance of the various provinces may also vary.]</p>
<p>The provincial governors shall be as now political chiefs, judges of
first instance, subdelegates of the treasury for the receiving of the
direct incomes, managers of the mails, and war captains. This
centralization has many advantages, a very chief one being the
economic. The inconveniences which follow from it, will disappear when
there is one supreme authority in the islands.</p>
<p>The limits of the provincial courts shall be enlarged to include
both civil and criminal cases. This will increase the power of the
subordinate authorities, and decrease the troubles of the Audiencia.
The party [in the suit] shall always have the recourse of appeal.</p>
<p>The superior court of justice shall be composed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>of three
persons, one of whom shall be the president. It shall try criminal,
civil, and contentious matters as well as trade questions by appeal.
Appeal may be had from its sentences to the regency, which shall
appoint three advocates to judge the case. These latter shall become
joint judges, and together with the three judges shall form the court
of appeal. This court shall be presided over by one of the regents or
by the substitute with a vote, the jurisconsult member being rightly
preferred for this if there is one in the regency.</p>
<p>[The fees of the court of appeal shall be larger than those of the
Audiencia; and if the decision of the latter is found correct the
penalty shall be increased; the death sentence, however, being
abolished. A vacancy in the court of justice shall be filled
provisionally by the regency, and regular appointment shall be made
from Madrid, which must be otherwise than the provisional one made by
the regency, unless such appointment be made before the action of the
regents is known in Spain. This will tend to make the judiciary
independent of the government.]</p>
<p>[In regard to the treasury employes a plan similar to that of the
provincial governors shall be adopted. The custom of sending employes
for any of the treasury posts from Madrid, many of whom are ignorant
even of bookkeeping, means death to the hopes of those already in the
islands, and breeds discontent.]</p>
<p>[This plan does not involve any extra expense. The president shall
have a yearly salary of 12,000 pesos, in addition to the palace of
Manila and the house at <span class="corr" id="xd27e1445" title=
"Source: Malacalang">Malaca&ntilde;ang</span>; the two regents shall
each receive 6,000 pesos and 1,000 pesos extra for a house;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>and the substitute 4,000 pesos&mdash;a total of
30,000 pesos.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1450src" href="#xd27e1450"
name="xd27e1450src">32</a> Posts of rank in Manila have lately been
increased, and now there are a lieutenant-general, a mariscal de campo,
six brigadier-generals, and many colonels and commandants; and yet men
of lower rank than all these have been appointed governor of the
islands. There is no need of so many military titles. A
brigadier-general, with 6,000 pesos&rsquo; pay acts as second
commandant of the navy, which consists of but a few gunboats; and a
sub-inspector of engineers has just arrived who has only two officers
under him. Colonels can serve in place of brigadiers, and since they
receive 2,000 pesos less, this will be a saving of at least 10,000
pesos. This added to the 7,000 pesos that can be saved from the affairs
of justice being managed by three persons, who have no administrational
duties, the 13,000 pesos saved from the present salary of the
captain-general, and the 1,000 pesos given as a gratification to the
commandant of the marine corps, will mean a total saving of 31,000
pesos.]</p>
<p>[Mas also proposes the establishment at Madrid of a ministry of the
colonies,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1461src" href="#xd27e1461" name=
"xd27e1461src">33</a> through whom all the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>communications of the regency shall pass. It
should have departments of government, war, navy, revenues, and
justice. It can easily turn over to other ministries what primarily
concerns them, and work in harmony with them. For instance it would not
elect bishops, but would determine their number and salary.]</p>
<p>Thus far I have given minute details on the three principles which,
in my opinion, I said it was necessary to adopt as basic policies in
order to conserve the Filipinas: namely, to avoid the increase of the
white population; make of the colored population, a docile and
well-inclined mass; and reform the present administration. I have still
to add that I conceive it to be of the foremost interest to always have
in that treasury a sufficient store of spare funds to at least cover
the expenses of one year. [It will be impossible to realize loans in
case of either internal or external war. The treasury has been
continually exhausted for years, and has drawn on the obras
p&iacute;as. Notes have been drawn on the Manila treasury for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>over three million pesos, on which interest is
being paid, and there is no hope of paying the principal.] Such a
method of doing things, is, in my opinion, a political imprudence twice
over&mdash;in the first place because the islands are left exposed to
reverses from a faction or from a foreign enemy; in the second, because
it causes certain murmurs among their inhabitants, and a discontent
difficult to conceive of here, and which may precipitate their
ruin.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>After having discussed the means of conserving the colony, supposing
that this is always the intention of the government, let us consider
the other extreme, taken in review, namely, to resolve to emancipate it
and prepare it for giving it liberty.</p>
<p>In order to attain this end, it becomes natural, as is necessary, to
adopt a system diametrically opposed to the first. The chief object
must be that it does not cause the shedding of blood, that the
relations of friendship and of trade with Espa&ntilde;a are not
interrupted, that the European Spaniards living there do not lose their
chattels or landed property, and, especially, that our race there, the
Filipino-Spaniards, preserve their estates and their rights of
naturalization, and free from the unfortunate fate that threatens them,
and which is even inevitably expected for them, if the colony separates
by force and at this moment. It is needful to encourage public
instruction in all ways possible, permit newspapers subject to a
liberal censure, to establish in Manila a college of medicine, surgery,
and pharmacy: in order to break down the barriers that divide the
races, and amalgamate them all into one. For that purpose, the
Spaniards of the country, the Chinese mestizos, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>the
Filipinos shall be admitted with perfect equality as cadets of the
military corps; the personal-service tax shall be abolished, or an
equal and general tax shall be imposed, to which all the Spaniards
shall be subject. This last plan appears to me more advisable, as the
poll-tax is already established, and it is not opportune to make a
trial of new taxes when it is a question of allowing the country to be
governed by itself. Since the annual tribute is unequal, the average
shall be taken and shall be fixed, consequently, at fifteen or sixteen
reals per whole tribute, or perhaps one peso fuerte annually from each
adult tributary person. This regulation will produce an increase in the
revenue of 200,000 or 300,000 pesos fuertes, and this sum shall be set
aside to give the impulse for the amalgamation of the races, favoring
crossed marriages by means of dowries granted to the single women in
the following manner. To a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Filipino
shall be given 100 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Chinese
mestizo, 100 pesos; to a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Spaniard,
1,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, 2,000
pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Spaniard, 2,000 pesos; to a
Spanish woman who marries a Filipino chief, 3,000 or 4,000 pesos. Some
mestizo and Filipino alcaldes-mayor of the provinces shall be
appointed. It shall be ordered that when a Filipino chief goes to the

In a word, by these and other means, the idea that they and the
Castilians are two kinds of distinct races shall be erased from the
minds of the natives, and the families shall become related by marriage
in such manner that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"

any exalted Filipinos try to expel or enslave our race, they would find
it so interlaced with their own that their plan would be practically
impossible.</p>
<p>After some years, when this population was sufficiently trimmed off,
an assembly of deputies shall be formed from the people, in order that
they may hold sessions in Manila for two or three months every year. In
those sessions they shall discuss public affairs, especially those
treating of taxes and budgets. Then after some time of such political
education, our government may be withdrawn without fear, fixing before
doing that the kind of government that is to be
established&mdash;probably some constitutional form analogous to those
of Europe, with a royal prince at its head chosen from among our
infantes.</p>
<p>My task is concluded. Which of the two plans, above analyzed, it is
the most just or advisable to follow, does not concern me to recommend,
much less propose.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>I will add, however, a page to express my opinion as an individual
of the Spanish nation. If I had to choose I would vote for the last. I
cannot see what benefits we have had from the colonies: depopulation,
decadence in the arts, and the public debt, which come in great measure
from them. The interest of a state consists, as I see it, in having a
dense and well-educated population, and I do not speak only of literary
or political education, but of that general education, which makes each
one perfect in his trade, I mean in that education which constitutes a
cabinet-maker, a weaver, a blacksmith, the best cabinet-maker, weaver,
or blacksmith possible. The greater <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88"
href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>or less number of machines is,
in our century, an almost sure thermometer by which to gage the power
of empires.</p>
<p>A colony cannot be useful except with the end of filling one of the
following three objects: to make of it a tributary country, for the
increase of the income of the mother-country (as Holland effects by
means of a compulsory and exclusive system); to erect it into a second
country, and a place of immigration of the surplus population (such as
are especially Australia, Van Diemen&rsquo;s land and New Zealand);
finally to procure in it, a place wherein to expend the products of the
national manufactures (as is the principal aim of the modern colonial
establishments). For the first, we have already seen that the Filipinas
are a poor resource, and will be for a long time; and I shall not
wonder that before losing them, they will cost us, on the contrary,
some millions. As for the second, they are not necessary, for we have
no surplus population to unload. And for the third they are useless,
for we ourselves have no manufactures to export. Barcelona, which has
the most factories in the Peninsula, does not have the least direct
communication with the islands. All that is taken there from Cadiz
consists of a little paper, oil, and liquors. If it were not for the
tobacco and the passengers who go and come, one or two vessels annually
would be enough to take care of all the mercantile speculations between
both countries. [Separation will not deprive Spain of a future rich
market in the Philippines, as the case of the American colonies and
England shows. Even if Spain should have a surplus population within a
century, the Philippines will also have no lack of inhabitants, and it
will be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>necessary for the Spaniards to emigrate to the
Marianas. Mas is not concerned by the argument that separation would
mean the loss of the Christian religion in the islands. To the argument
that the islands might fall into the hands of the British, French,
Dutch, or Chinese, he asks why Spain should become a knight errant for
all unprotected peoples. Spaniards in the islands can always return to
Spain. People assert that since Spain has spent over 300,000,000 pesos
on the islands, it is but proper that that country be reimbursed; but
although it has also spent much on the holy land, it never expects any
return therefor. Let the Filipinos pay heavier taxes under their own
government; why is that any concern? Even if ninety per cent of the
population should desire to remain under Spain&rsquo;s domination, that
is no sign that there may not be a better condition.] In conclusion, if
we are conserving the islands for love of the islanders, we are losing
our time, and merit, for gratitude is sometimes met with in persons,
but never can it be hoped for from peoples; and indeed through our
love, why do we fall into an anomaly, such as combining our claim for
liberty for ourselves, and our wish at the same time to impose our law
on remote peoples? Why do we deny to others the benefit which we desire
for our fatherland? By these principles of universal morality and
justice, and because I am persuaded that in the midst of the political
circumstances in which Espa&ntilde;a is at present, the condition of
that colony will be neglected; that none of the measures which I
propose for its conservation (this is my conviction) will be adopted;
and that it will emancipate itself violently with the loss of
considerable property and many lives of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

first to show generosity. Hence, the foreign authors who have unjustly
printed so many calumnies against our colonial governments, authors
belonging to nations who never satisfy their hunger for colonies, would
have to say at least this once: &ldquo;The Spaniards crossing new and
remote seas, extended the domain of geography by discovering the
Filipinas Islands. They found anarchy and despotism there, and
established order and justice. They encountered slavery and destroyed
it, and imposed political equality. They ruled their inhabitants with

them from the Chinese, from Moro pirates, and from European aggressors;
they spent much gold on them, and then gave them
liberty.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1515src" href="#xd27e1515"

Sinibaldo de Mas, a noted Spanish traveler and diplomat. He was born at
Barcelona, in 1809, and studied at Madrid, especially the classic
languages, Arabic and other modern languages. In 1634, he was sent on a
diplomatic mission to the Orient, where he visited successively
Constantinople, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Calcutta, the Arabian desert,
and lastly Manila, where he lived for some months. After his return to
the Peninsula, he was appointed Spanish minister plenipotentiary to
China. Pardo de Tavera says of him (<i lang="es">Biblioteca
Filipina</i>, p. 253): &ldquo;The work of Mas is highly interesting,
only that, having sojourned a very short time in Filipinas, during
which he was sick most of the time, he wrote his work by reference to
others, and taking from the chronicles of the friars the elements
necessary for the history and the races. He does not cite sources, and
it is cleverly written, and passes with some persons as a classic work
on Filipinas&#8202;&hellip;. His vanity led him to suppress his
name&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; Pardo de Tavera does not seem to know the
third volume. Retana [who possessed a copy of the third volume (No.
2432 in his library, which was sold to the Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a

copies of it because of the gravity of its contents. Sinibaldo de Mas
contrary to what those who know his <i lang="es">Estado</i>

of preparation of independence for Filipinas.&rdquo; In this third
volume Mas precedes the text as follows: &ldquo;Of this secret chapter,
the last of the <i lang="es">Informe sobre el estado de las Islas
Filipinas en 1842</i>, only some few copies have been printed for the
ministers, gentlemen of the Council of the Government, and other
persons influential in the affairs of the nation. Consequently, your

Mas at this point discusses the other admissible plan, &ldquo;namely,
to cede the country to some foreign power.&rdquo; But the religious,
the majority of the military and civil employes, and the
Filipino-Spaniards would prefer independence to transfer, and the
simple announcement of such transfer would lead to almost universal
insurrection. The fatal results that ensued from the former English
policy of sending convicts to their colonies declares against making
the Philippines a penal colony. Another plan, namely, to send out
Spanish emigrants from the Peninsula, is also not feasible, for Spain
has no surplus population, and in fact needs a greater population. On
the matter of penal colonies, Forrest (<i lang="fr">Voyage</i>, p. 198)
says, &ldquo;The Spaniards at Manila transport convicts to Samboangan,
as England did to America.&rdquo; In 1875&ndash;78, there was some
discussion of the question as to whether Spain should establish penal
colonies (like that of Botany Bay) in the Marianas Islands or in the

long note at this point, Mas severely criticises Camba&rsquo;s book,
which he has already mentioned. He declares it lacking in knowledge of
the Philippines, and says that it was written to prove that the
Philippines are thoroughly loyal in every respect. Mas&rsquo;s own
experience pointed to the existence of an independence party among the
Spaniards of the colony. Mas condemns Camba&rsquo;s policy of giving
posts to the natives; as well as Camba&rsquo;s assertions of the
immunity of the governor from removal at the will of the monarch. Camba
is accused of a change of sentiment from that which he had during his

at this point by Mas mentions a recent pamphlet by a Cuban who
advocates complete autonomy for the colonies, and freedom of the press.
This author says that long before the French revolution free negroes
and mulattoes were being educated in Paris; but Mas says people of that
class in Cuba do not travel in foreign countries or receive an
education in European colleges.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

cites a passage from Captain Gabriel Lafond&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Quinze
ans de voyages autour du monde</i> (1840) to the effect that the
Philippine conquest was one of religion. The power of the friars grows
because they are permanent in the colony. Their influence over the
natives is all powerful, and they regard foreigners and even other
Spaniards with suspicion. The friars asserted that the natives to be
happy had no need of European civilization; yet they prevented progress
by not allowing the entrance of industry. Spain did not suppress the
orders in the Philippines, fearing lest it lead to independence. The
native priests are those most hostile to the friars. They are almost
without education and often dissolute; and are sure to be the first
authors of a revolution. Natives should be excluded from the
priesthood.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e1085src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1093" href="#xd27e1093src" name="xd27e1093">14</a></span> The
insurrection which occurred recently in Tayabas is a patent proof of
these truths. The cura of the village where the confraternity of San
Jos&eacute; was established, advised the alcalde of the province in
time of the suspicions with which it infused him. And since the
alcalde-mayor refused to consider the matter, he wrote him: &ldquo;You
will be the first victim,&rdquo; as in truth he was. The cura of the
next village also took great interest in it, and so many letters were
written to the archbishop of Manila from various places, that the
latter sent an official communication to the captain-general. Orders
were then issued for the arrest of Apolinario de Santa Cruz, but he
fled. The brothers [of the confraternity] held their meetings in the
village of Mahahay. The cura informed the archbishop thereof, telling
him that, notwithstanding all that he had done, he had been unable to
dissuade them from this undertaking. The archbishop sent this advice to
the government. To the curas, then, was due the discovery of that
crafty conspiracy; and it is almost beyond the pale of doubt that if
there had been no others than Filipino parish priests in the villages
(as has been once ordered by the government), there would not have been
the slightest suspicion of it, until it had been so firmly and
generally organized that our ruin would have been the work of a week.

was the payment of the tribute in cash made universal. There are,
besides, three other taxes; the <i lang="la">sanctorum</i>, 3 reals;
the <i lang="es">comunidad</i>, 1 real; and the <i>recargo</i>,
&frac12; real. The total of imposts, then, is 16&frac12; reals; or for
each single person one dollar and &frac14; real. The <i lang=

resulting therefrom. In Mindanao and the Bisayas no additional charge
is collected. According to Agius (<i lang="es">Memoria</i>, doc. 5)

of <i lang="es">recargo</i>, in all 6.8 reals, not considering the

2&frac14; reals for the permission to buy their tobacco outside the
monopoly dealers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mestizos by a Chinese man and an Indian
woman pay a tribute of $3.00 a year since 1852; earlier, it was less.
The Indian woman married to a mestizo of this class pays the same
tribute as he during their marriage; but when she becomes a widow she
pays only as an Indian woman. Mestizos who, like the natives, cultivate
the soil with their own hands, also pay only as the latter do. The
mestizos form their own barangays when there are 25 to 30 tributes of
them living together; otherwise they belong to the nearest barangay of
natives. Every Chinaman&mdash;excepting tillers of the soil, from whom
only 12 reals are collected&mdash;pays since 1852 a [capitation]
head-tax of $6.00, and, besides this, an industrial tax of $100, $60,
$30, or $12.&rdquo;</p>

procure release from it by a money payment. But this law was not put
into execution, and Europeans are free from all imposts. Mestizos by

office was united that of the subdelegate superintendency of the

the islands. The first incumbent of the new office was Ciriaco Gonzalez

through its respective ministries, and after deliberation the course to
be followed would be ordered. Throughout the history of the
Philippines, this method often proved a great drawback to effective

at this point states that the polo and service tax had not been
extended to the Chinese mestizos, who were not in existence when the
tax was first imposed, or were but few, until a few years back, when
the natives of Lingayen brought up the matter. Chinese mestizos formed
the wealthiest part of many villages; and it was decided that since
they were to the natives as 1:6, they should pay such taxes for one
month to the natives&rsquo; six. At Vigan, Ilocos Sur, the natives also
presented a petition against the mestizos because natives alone were
compelled to furnish provisions, etc., to the troops in their province
at the schedule price, while the mestizos escaped; and for which reason
many of the natives joined the mestizo ranks, saying that the state
profited thereby because as mestizos they paid a double tribute.
Governor Ora&aacute;, however, imposed a fine for such
denaturalization. As regards the petition against the mestizos, an
expediente was formed, and in July, 1841, the natives were ordered to
send a salaried agent to conduct a suit against the mestizos. But they
being poor could not do so, while it was understood that the mestizos
had paid a bribe of 1,000 pesos to the assessor. Consequently, it
appears that notwithstanding the efforts of the alcalde-mayor and Mas,
nothing could be done, as the governor was so hedged in.&nbsp;<a class=

Francisco Enriquez succeeded Urrijola (who had been appointed October,
1820, as intendant-general of the army and treasury), in the office of
intendant in 1828, being granted more ample powers than the latter had
enjoyed. By a royal decree of October 27, 1829, it was ordered that the
superintendency should be held by the intendant of the army and royal
treasury, and accordingly Enriquez took such charge on September 9,
1630. See Montero y Vidal, <i lang="es">Hist. gen.</i>, ii, pp. 457,

<p class="first"><i>Communication from the intendant of the army and
treasury [Intendente de Ejercito y Hacienda]</i> of <i>the Filipinas
Islands, Don Juan Manuel de la Matta,<a class="noteref" id=

governor and captain-general of said islands, Don Marcelino
Ora&aacute;, in regard to the moral condition of the country after the
insurrection of a portion of the troops of the third regiment of the
line, which happened at daybreak of the twenty-first of last January;
and declaration of the chief legislative reforms, and of the peremptory
measures of precaution and security, demanded by said
condition.</i></p>
<p>[The recent disaffection of a portion of the Philippine troops has
caused the government to issue instructions in case of the occurrence
of any excitement, insurrection, or alarm in the city of Manila and its
environs. Matta, on receiving these instructions, has transmitted
secretly to the commander of the revenue guard<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1540src" href="#xd27e1540" name="xd27e1540src">2</a> (whom he has
advised in case <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>of any danger to assemble all his command in the
tobacco factory of Binondo) the portion of the instructions that
concerns him. Also the forces of the station of San Fernando are to be
embarked on the boats in the river belonging to the revenue guard, and
placed in command of the port captain. In addition to the instructions
above cited, it seems advisable, &ldquo;considering the moral condition
of the country, to adopt radical measures to avoid the evil before
having to punish it, thereby to shelter the colony from new seditions,
which cannot be repeated without imminent risk of sad
consequences.&rdquo; The suppression of the attempts of the insurgents
and the calming of Manila was due to the loyalty of the artillerymen
quartered at the fort of Santiago and the presence of other loyal
troops.]</p>
<p>The sedition of Apolinario<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1549src" href=
"#xd27e1549" name="xd27e1549src">3</a> in the province of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>Tayabas,
at the end of October, 1841, and the insurrection of part of the third
regiment of the line, which occurred in the capital at daybreak of
January 21,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1575src" href="#xd27e1575" name=
"xd27e1575src">4</a> have in little more than one year placed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>these important possessions at the verge of a
terrible civil war, and have compromised great interests.</p>
<p>[The discipline of the third regiment of the line before the
insurrection was poor, a fact that was attributed, among other things,
to the bad condition of the barracks. On the other hand, a corps
composed of native troops recruited from Manila and the neighboring
places remained loyal, and was used to good effect in putting down the
insurrection. In the opinion of many, native troops officered by
Spaniards (even to the sergeants and corporals) would prevent
disaffection in the future, and be much better than Peninsular troops.
In this treatise it is Matta&rsquo;s purpose to set forth &ldquo;the
measures by which the tranquillity of these inhabitants and the
conservation of this precious portion of the Spanish monarchy, will be
conserved in the future.&rdquo; The moral condition of the islands is
most delicate and merits the close attention of the government,
&ldquo;and most especially of your Excellency, to whom is chiefly
confided the tranquillity and conservation of these important
possessions&mdash;which now demand radical administrational and
economic reforms that will permit the development of the wealth of
their fertile soil, and the welfare of all their inhabitants; and
peremptory <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>measures of foresight and security, which will
render those advantages lasting, keep the country loyal, and
inalterably bind the union of the islands with the
mother-country.&rdquo; In consequence of the civil wars in Spain, the
Spanish government has been compelled to draw heavy sums against the
treasury of the Philippines, by which not only has the treasury been
exhausted but a debt of more than four million pesos incurred&mdash;a
debt that cannot be met for years, &ldquo;both because the needs of the
colony are increasing annually, and because the remainder left from the
revenues, after covering the ordinary obligations of the budgets, is
almost all spent in tobacco leaf, which is sent for the <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e1589" title="Source: comsumption">consumption</span> of
the mother-country, in accordance with the orders of the
government.&rdquo; In regard to the military defense of the country,
conditions are as bad. &ldquo;There are but few arms and they are in
poor shape. The provinces are undefended. The army is composed almost
exclusively of natives, and they are so few in number that the army is
<span class="corr" id="xd27e1592" title=
"Source: insufficent">insufficient</span> to defend the capital and
fort of Cavite in case of a foreign invasion.&rdquo; Indeed, in case of
invasion it might be best to raze the fortifications built at the
expense of so great sacrifices.]</p>
<p>In general there is to be seen considerable indifference, and even
disaffection, to Peninsular interests. Ideas of emancipation are
sheltered in many bosoms. Discontent swarms in all places. It is given
utterance with effrontery, and is developed and fomented in various
manners. Since the beginning of the colony, boldness, deceit, and
acrimonious speech have had a foremost seat, but greed is today the
dominant passion in the white people. Their needs are many and there
are few means of satisfying them. The hot climate especially
contributes to captiousness, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>and the development of vehement
passions. A multitude of jealous, complaining, and evil-intentioned men
foment the discontent, to which also pusillanimous persons contribute
by their indiscreet and excessive fear. Although by means of different
passions, there is a manifest tendency to constantly discredit the
dispositions of the government, to attack maliciously the authorities
who represent it, and to foment rivalry and discord among them, to
which both the complexity of the legislation and the burning climate
lend themselves. Thus all concur in weakening the prestige that gives
force to the government. The malcontents have the necessary time to
gather new proselytes, to consolidate a faction against the
mother-country, to prepare the will of the masses; and they await the
time and opportunity for the realization of their desires. This plan is
not in writing, but is <span class="corr" id="xd27e1599" title=
"Source: engraven">engraved</span> in the hearts of those who direct
it, shows itself by its works, and is the result of the tendency of the
age, of the calamitous circumstances in which the mother-country finds
itself, and of the kind of abandonment in which these important
possessions are held.</p>
<p>[Notwithstanding the royal order of April 25, 1837, prohibiting
publications that might disturb public order and weaken the prestige of
the government, such publications have circulated freely in Manila,
thus increasing the discontent. In such publications the followers of
Apolinario are called innocent, and the execution of the rebels in the
camp of Alitao has been termed assassination. All things have combined
to destroy in Manila &ldquo;the prestige and moral force that have been
hitherto the principal foundation of our domination.&rdquo;]
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>[Although the provinces are not yet so greatly disaffected as is
Manila], their moral condition is very different from that when they
generally pronounced against the English in 1762 and gave the victory
to Anda. Mejico belonged to Espa&ntilde;a, and its treasury contributed
to the support of the islands, which had the exclusive benefit of a
traffic which the public especially valued, and whose conservation was
inseparable from union to the mother-country. North-American
independence and the French revolution had not yet come to fix the
future destiny of all the colonial possessions of the world.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1607src" href="#xd27e1607" name="xd27e1607src">5</a>
The regular clergy, the principal base of our domination, then
exercised an influence over the inhabitants, which time has almost
entirely vitiated. Little care is taken for the instruction of their
members, from which it results that some of them with their gross
manners, stupid pretensions, and exactions from the chiefs of the
provinces, and the gobernadorcillos and notables of the villages,
occasion anger, quarrels, and discord which disturb the quiet of the
inhabitants, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>distract and embarrass the authorities, and
nourish those indiscreet and tenacious struggles in which all lose, and
which have contributed so greatly to the rapid undermining of the base
of our power in the provinces. The mistrust of a sad future leads many
of them to engage in commercial business, and conduces to avarice and
to a worldly life, so that they have lost their religious prestige,
without gaining the respect and the consideration due to eminent and
beneficent citizens. Without doubt there are respectable men among the
individuals of the regular clergy, who, superior to circumstances,
devote themselves entirely to the fulfilment of the duties of their
sacred ministry; who as true fathers of their parishioners, look
carefully after their comfort and welfare; and who, for that reason
possessing their esteem, are, consequently, one of the chief supports
of the action of the government in the villages. It is with reference
to these that I have remarked in another place that both religion and
policy recommend them. Let all be placed in the same category, and let
strict watch be put on the instruction and conduct of the parish
priests, in which, truly, there is much to correct; and the happiness
of the provinces will be secure, if, in addition, the improvements
demanded by the state of civilization and of wealth in some of the
provinces, and by the genius and circumstances of the various races
inhabiting them, and the differences of the times in which we are
living, are made in their government and administration.</p>
<p>For that purpose it must be kept in mind that ambition is wont to
affect the Spanish people transplanted to these distant and hot climes;
that arrogant presumption is the distinctive characteristic of their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>descendants; and we must consider duly the
characteristic qualities of the natives.</p>
<p>As I have remarked to your Excellency on a different occasion, I
consider the moral picture of the Indian as very difficult to draw, for
frequently one finds united in him abjectness and ferocity, timidity
and a wonderful fearlessness and courage in danger, and indolent
laziness and slovenliness combined with industry and avaricious
self-interest. It is impossible to represent exactly under one single
stroke all the phases of their contradictory character. But in general
the Indian is pacific, superstitious, indolent, respectful to
authority, heedless, distrustful, and deceitful. Dominated by his first
sensations, and most fertile in expedients to extricate himself from
difficulties, or to carry out his design at a moment&rsquo;s notice, he
must be considered as a minor who follows the dictates of his own will;
and, as such, he must be directed for his own good, his difficulties
must be forestalled, corrected and punished. The natives are also
spiteful and revengeful when they believe themselves offended; and at
such times, hiding their ill-will under the veil of a deceitful
humility, they await the opportunity for satisfying it, and generally
give rein suddenly to their ill-will with perfidy and ferocity.</p>
<p>[The contradictory character of the Filipino native explains the
ease with which a large province can be governed by one official with
the aid of the parish priests and two or three dozen soldiers; while,
on the other hand, the insurance companies of India refuse to stand the
risks of mutiny in a vessel employing half a dozen natives from Manila
in its crew. The natives know no middle path between abject respect and
insolent contempt, in their attitude toward <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>the
whites. In case of a foreign or internal war the governors or
alcaldes-mayor of the provinces would be the least capable of directing
affairs, because of their ignorance of the native languages and
customs, and because they are in continual conflict with the natives
over the collection of the tribute, while at the same time they
exercise a monopoly in trade.]</p>
<p>For a very long period the elements of discord among the authorities
have been numerous for lack of a special and analogous legislation,
enacted with regard to the genius and circumstances of the various
peoples inhabiting these islands and the enormous distance separating
them from the mother-country. During these latter years, there have
been heaped up on this unfavorable foundation the elements emanating
from the civil war which has covered the mother-country with mourning,
and those of our own political dissensions; the development and
tendencies of the revolutionary principles common to all the colonial
possessions of the world, and which only force, supported by the
interest of self-preservation, is capable of restraining; and lastly
the impressions which it has been impossible to keep from transmission
to the natives and other races, in proportion as the knowledge of our
language becomes general to them, and as they become civilized, and
contract our tastes and necessities through the increase of commerce
and industry, and observe from anear the confusion resulting from our
lack of harmony. This is, in my opinion, the chief cancer of this body
politic, and will finish it very speedily unless your Excellency,
acting with the discretion and the energy so strongly charged in the
laws, and especially in the royal order of April 25, 1837, apply the
remedy peremptorily demanded by our situation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>[Discord and confusion and the spirit of resistance are rife
throughout the provinces. The events of 1820 and 1823, the sedition of
Apolinario in October, 1841, and the mutiny of the troops, although
different in their origin, all exhibit the &ldquo;perfidy and ferocity
that always accompany movements of <i>color</i> in Ultramar.&rdquo; The
prestige of the government is weakened, which formerly was, with
religion, the chief foundation of Spanish domination. The political
factions that have arisen in the last six years, and which are now
perfectly organized, are greatly to blame. The Peninsulars and Spanish
Filipinos will end by destroying each other if the fitting remedy is
not speedily applied. In a report made to the government after the
sedition of Apolinario had been put down, Matta said that the origin of
the confraternity consisted &ldquo;only in the character of the
superstition which distinguishes these natives, who most readily
believe whatever is presented to them under the veil of religion and of
the marvellous; asserted that it became fanaticism as soon as measures
were taken against Apolinario and his confreres, and that it became a
declared sedition when the unfortunate Ortega attacked them in Ygsaban
with more valor than prudence; and that from that time presenting the
appearance of a near insurrection in the neighboring provinces, it is
to be feared that it would have been converted into a revolution
capable of compromising the conservation of these important possessions
had not the seditious ones been promptly defeated and severely punished
in Alitao.&rdquo; Matta&rsquo;s report also said that probably
Apolinario&rsquo;s expulsion from the hospital of San Juan de Dios in
Manila, and the measures taken against his associates, together with
the suggestions of the adherents of independence, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>contributed to the holding of the novena in
Tayabas in spite of the precautions taken by the military and
ecclesiastical authorities. These occurrences were principally the
effect of superstition and fanaticism; and although the ideas of
emancipation have been present in the Philippines, as in all colonies
since the Spanish-American revolution, yet ideas of emancipation are
limited in the islands to a few Spaniards who do not even form a
political party, but only a crowd of complainers who are either not
government employees, or are employees who take it ill that Spaniards
are sent from the Peninsula to fill offices that they believe belong
properly to themselves.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1636src" href=
"#xd27e1636" name="xd27e1636src">6</a> The ideas of emancipation have
not yet contaminated, nor will they in a long time contaminate the
Chinese, the Chinese mestizos, Spanish mestizos, or the natives, with
the exception of a few of the &ldquo;secular clergy, as insignificant
because of their ignorance and few resources as by their lack of
influence among their countrymen.&rdquo; Whatever be the opinions of
the influential Spaniards born in the islands, they recognise that
political upheavals would be as fatal to themselves as to the
Peninsulars. In the insurrection of last January, among the six white
officers assassinated or wounded, three of those killed and one wounded
belonged to the revolting regiment, while the two remaining who were
wounded were Europeans. The safety of all lies in the stability of the
government; but it must be noted that events are daily more serious and
that the discontent is spreading. Important reforms are necessary, but
matters must be viewed only in the light of the public cause.
&ldquo;Without virtues there can be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>no prestige; and,
without prestige, it will also be impossible for the lesser part to
dominate the great whole.&rdquo; The conservation of the islands
depends on &ldquo;radical reforms in their legislation, and peremptory
measures of precaution and security.&rdquo; Such reforms are:]</p>
<p>1st. The formation of a special law for these islands, analogous and
framed with reference to the genius and circumstances of the various
peoples inhabiting them, and to their great distance from the
mother-country. [Matta believes in a law that will outline the duties
of the governor and captain-general, and place under his general
supervision real heads of the various departments of government, who
shall be responsible. A Colonial Council or Cabinet for consultation on
affairs of general public interest should also be formed. This
separation of duties into specific classes, the heads of each
department to be subordinate to the governor, in accordance with law
ii, t&iacute;tulo ii, book iii, will ensure the right use of the
governing functions. To continue so many unconnected duties under the
governor will only add to the confusion.]</p>
<p>2d. The improvement of the government and administration of the
provinces by organizing them with reference to their present state of
civilization and wealth. For they cannot now, without serious
inconveniences, without transcendental harm, have the government,
judicial, military and revenue functions, together with commercial
occupations and cares, united under one person alone. [The system of
placing one person in command of all these departments is opposed to
civilization and to the mercantile spirit that has penetrated into the
provinces. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>Civil governors should be appointed who should
have charge of the government, administration of justice, and the
promotion of the welfare of the inhabitants. Such governors should have
learned the native tongue and should know something of the native
manners and customs. The collection of tributes should not be entrusted
to them, and their posts should be permanent, except for transfers,
promotions, and suspension by the governor and captain-general, or
sentence by the suitable tribunal. This will give such provincial
chiefs the necessary prestige, in accordance with the royal order of
December 10, 1839. In the provinces, passion often takes the place of
reason, and anything at all can be justified because of the facility
with which the natives contradict and perjure themselves. The position
of the provincial chief demands that his authority be very vigorous and
held in respect. The native must be kept respectful by tact, justice,
punishment, and energy. <i lang="es">Jueces pesquisidores</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1652src" href="#xd27e1652" name="xd27e1652src">7</a>
and judges to take the residencia should not be sent to the provinces,
as that tends to weaken the authority of the provincial chief. Easy
recourse can be had in the provinces to the tribunals and superior
authorities of the islands, while the natives and Chinese can appeal to
their protectors, who are generally very zealous in their behalf.]</p>
<p>3rd. The suppression of the colleges of Santo Tomas, San
Jose,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1657src" href="#xd27e1657" name=
"xd27e1657src">8</a> and San Juan de Letran of this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>capital, and the conciliar seminaries of the
bishoprics, as perpetual nurseries of corruption, laziness, or
subversive ideas, as contrary to the quiet and welfare of the villages
as to peninsular interests. [The suppression of the last three can be
made at once, and they should be replaced with schools of
agriculture,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1664src" href="#xd27e1664"
name="xd27e1664src">9</a> arts,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1673src"
href="#xd27e1673" name="xd27e1673src">10</a> and commerce, which will
conduce to the prosperity of the colony. As regards Santo Tomas,
inasmuch as immediate suppression would anger the Spaniards and Chinese
mestizos who have control of almost all the capital of the islands, a
new plan should be adopted by which desire to attend it would be
gradually decreased until it can be suppressed without any trouble.
Sensible Spaniards generally believe that the suppression of these
institutions would conduce to the good of the islands and of Spain.
From them come the swarms of ignorant and vicious secular priests, and
the pettifogging lawyers, who stir up so much trouble among the
natives, and cause the provincial chiefs so great inconvenience.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>Although not much attention is paid to this
class, they are the most vicious and worthless in the islands. Public
convenience demands the teaching of agriculture, the arts, and
commerce, instead of the theology and law to which the institutions
above mentioned are devoted. It should not be forgotten that the
Spanish-American revolutions were fostered by curas and lawyers, who
since they know both the native language and Spanish, have great
influence with the masses. The influence of the friar parish priests is
now very much weakened, for they have almost entirely abandoned the
spiritual administration to their native assistants. These assistants,
by working on the superstitious character of the natives, can rouse
them to any act that will satisfy their own desires for vengeance.]</p>
<p>4th. The eternal abolition of the sentences of residencia, to which,
as governors, the captains-general of the provinces of Ultramar are
still subject. [These sentences have been of no use to the inhabitants
of the islands, but on the contrary of great harm. Appeal lies to the
Audiencia from the judicial acts of the governor, and to the Spanish
court from his purely administrational acts. The free press, in which
all things are bruited, is also of great use. Communication with Spain
is now frequent. The governor and the chief of the treasury have been
divested of almost all governmental authority through the residencia.
The judicial and contentious have invaded everything and obscured the
action of the provincial chiefs as well as the superintendent and
intendant and the governor. The chief authorities of the islands need
more energy and freer action.]</p>
<p>5th. [The adoption of various other legislative <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>and
economic measures which Matta has before proposed to the
government.]</p>
<p>[Capitalists and workers are needed in the islands, but, in order to
attract them, there must be governmental and administrational reforms.
The natives must be considered and various reforms made concerning
them, and the heavy tribute on the Chinese must be reduced to not more
than the twelve reals per annum for those engaging in agriculture. The
public wealth of the islands must be increased. Whites, Chinese, and
mestizos must be encouraged to go to the islands in greater numbers, in
order to correct the laziness of the natives, and, by their wealth and
prestige, to offset the numerical majority of the natives. The increase
of consumers in the islands will give a greater outlet to Spanish
products from the Peninsula. The revenues must be increased in
proportion to the public wealth, in order to sustain the increase of
necessary forces.]</p>
<p>[The reforms looking toward security and conservation which are
urgently demanded by the moral condition of the country are as
follows:]</p>
<p>1st. The re&euml;stablishment of the well-organized military
commission of police, vigilance, and public safety. [This would be able
to check all sorts of disorder and conspiracy. Its members should be
paid by the state, such pay to come from the licenses issued to
travelers going to the interior, from licenses to carry arms, from
fines, and from the fourth part of all contraband goods
confiscated.]</p>
<p>2d. The institution of night-watches in the city and villages
outside its walls, which require them, as almost all the traders and a
considerable portion of the white population live therein. [These
night-watches <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>would relieve the troops of patrol duty in many
instances. They would be under the alcaldes-in-ordinary, and paid from
the municipal funds.]</p>
<p>3rd. The constant maintenance of a guard of at least one thousand
European troops. [These are necessary for the garrisoning of the fort
at Santiago, the palace, the Pari&aacute;n gate, and the other
necessary points. Matta&rsquo;s plan also calls for the
re&euml;stablishment of the Spanish guard of halberdiers of one hundred
men, to act as interior palace guard, and serve as a source of supply
for sergeants for the native regiments. He recommends the establishment
of Tag&aacute;log academies in order that the Spanish officers and
sergeants may learn the native language.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1703src" href="#xd27e1703" name="xd27e1703src">11</a> Certain
privileges are proposed for the European soldiers, whereby their pay
may be greater than that of the native soldiers, for their necessities
are greater. The term of service in the Philippines ought to be eight
years, as provided by royal order of July 26, 1836; but those who are
fit ought to be allowed to re&euml;nlist and be transferred to the
revenue guard [<i lang="es">cuerpo del resguardo</i>], in order to save
cost on transportation. Matta is against having fewer Europeans in the
service as has been urged by many persons of experience in the
Philippines. The system outlined by him is not one merely of military
occupation, but looks to a close bond with the mother-country and to
the industrial development of the islands. Agriculture is the best
occupation for the whites, and is in fact the only one that will give a
good comfortable living. A greater number of Europeans will mean
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>a greater proportion of mestizos;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1717src" href="#xd27e1717" name=
"xd27e1717src">12</a> and if these, together with the Chinese and some
of the whites, engage in agriculture they will throw their influence on
the side of the government, because of self-interest. Exaggerated ideas
are voiced regarding the Peninsulars. They are never more dangerous
than during the first few years in the islands; but, as they become
accustomed to the climate and learn to know the inhabitants, their
ideas moderate. Consequently, for this reason, and because of the
expense, Matta is against frequent reliefs of soldiers. Vacancies in
the ranks should always be filled with recruits from Spain, and never
with natives. Discipline must not be relaxed on the voyage from Spain;
and the soldiers must be kept in good form physically. A special boat
is recommended for the transport of soldiers to and from Spain; and
cost of transport can be reduced.]</p>
<p>4th. The completion of the organization of the valuable corps of the
revenue guards [<i lang="es">cuerpo del resguardo</i>]. [This can be
done by carrying out the royal order of October 18, 1837, and the three
parts of the regulations drawn up by Matta&rsquo;s predecessor June 4,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>1841, the first two parts of which have already
been approved. Matta has endeavored without avail, and supported by
various officials, to gain the governor&rsquo;s approval to the third
part. The corps of the revenue guards is always loyal to the governor.
With the increase provided in the plan for organization, this corps
will be the most suitable to defend the country either against foreign
or internal foes. Since the immediate object of the revenue guards is
the custody, defense, and guard of the revenues, they ought to depend
immediately on the treasury department, although they may be available
when the public safety demands it for any other duty. By a decree of
Matta&rsquo;s predecessor, of April 25, 1839, the revenue guards of the
various departments&mdash;those of the Bay, and of the tobacco and wine
and liquor monopoly revenues&mdash;were united into one corps. This
extensive corps, which absorbs annually the sum of 191,589 pesos, has
no adequate organization, a matter to which immediate attention should
be given.]</p>
<p>5th and last. That the attempt be made, in a truly impartial and
foresighted system, to conciliate the minds of people, and to put an
end to that pernicious mistrust that has been introduced between the
peninsular Spaniards and the sons of the country [<i>i.e.</i>, the
Spaniards born in the Philippines], which is so contrary to the common
interest. [The government must not be partial to any one class of men,
for each class contains good men who should be rewarded and advanced,
and bad men who should be closely watched and punished. Merit should be
the only cause for advancement. In closing Matta says that his private
life in the islands and his long public service <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>have
given him abundant opportunity to observe and study people and
conditions. This memorial is dated Manila, February 25, 1843.]<a class=

1851), probably written by Pedro Chamorro; and Montero y Vidal,
<i lang="es">Hist. gen.</i>, iii, pp. 37&ndash;56. This confraternity
was founded by Apolinario de la Cruz, a Tag&aacute;log, a native of
Lucban in the province of Tayabas, who was a donn&eacute; in the
hospital of San Juan de Dios in Manila. The new confraternity soon had
many adherents in the provinces of Tayabas, Laguna, and Batangas, and
in the middle of 1840 began to hold meetings in Lucban, to which both
sexes were admitted, and at which letters from Apolinario were read.
The attention of the friar parish priests was directed to the
confraternity, and the meeting of October 19, 1840 was surprised and
about 243 persons out of the 500 or 600 attending it, arrested. The
governor of Tayabas province, however, who regarded the matter as
entirely one of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, ordered the prisoners to
be released. Through the representations of the parish priest of
Lucban, the provincial governor finally intervened, and the adherents
to the confraternity thereupon held their meetings secretly in Majayjay
in Laguna Province. The meeting of Sept. 19, 1841, at the latter place,
was surprised and some arrests made, although but few, as information
of the intended raid had been received. The departure of the provincial
governor of Tayabas, Joaquin Ortega, for Manila, was favorable to the
new sect, as a native adherent or sympathizer was left in charge of the
government. Through his acquiescence, the members of the confraternity
who had gathered in armed bands at the village of Bay in Laguna (where
they were joined by Apolinario, who had fled from Manila), were allowed
to ensconce themselves in Igsaban, Tayabas. From thence they opened
negotiations with the government at Tayabas to be allowed to occupy
that city, the substitute governor requesting from the parish priest
that they be allowed to hold a novena in his church. Negotiations
failed, and Ortega, returning on the twenty-second of October, ordered
the natives to disperse, and on their refusal attacked them the next
day with a force of over three hundred men. The natives, aided by a
band of Negritos who had joined them, repulsed this force and killed
Ortega, and then retired to Alitao to celebrate a novena. There they
were attacked on the first of November by a force composed of troops
sent by Ora&aacute;, and those of the province of Tayabas, and after a
severe engagement the natives were defeated. Apolinario, who fled, was
soon captured and shot on the fourth, others of the leaders being also
arrested. Apolinario was but twenty-seven years old, and evidently
worked on the superstitious nature of his countrymen, who believed that
he was immune from danger and that the rebel forces would be aided by
the direct intervention of heaven. His followers baptized him under the
name of &ldquo;The king of the Tag&aacute;logs.&rdquo; No one except
pure-blooded natives were allowed to become members of the
organization, from which circumstance the Spaniards have always
professed to believe that the confraternity was political in nature and
that religious motives were merely a blind. Some (as in Vindel&rsquo;s
<i lang="es">Cat&aacute;logo biblioteca filipina</i>, no. 1895) assert
that the confraternity was a sort of Katipunan. It is quite probable,
however, that its origin was entirely religious, but religion mingled
with superstition and fanaticism. The fact that Apolinario attempted to
legalize the existence of the organization through both ecclesiastical
and government centers, which was refused in both instances, indicates
that the insurrection was forced by the Spaniards, through either fear
or contempt. It is highly unlikely that the organization had at the
beginning any political motive, and its attempted suppression was a
mistake of the religious and civil authorities.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

defeat and slaughter of the members of the confraternity of San
Jos&eacute; angered the native soldiers from the Province of Tayabas,
who were quartered in Malate. Conspiring with some of the garrison of
the fort of Santiago, also from the same province, they attacked and
took that fort Jan. 20, 1843, under the leadership of two brothers
(mestizos and officers of the regiment), after killing the officers on
guard. The mutiny was quickly stilled by Ora&aacute;, and the commander
of the insurgents, a sergeant, Samaniego, and some of the other leaders
were shot on the twenty-second at the camp of Bagumbayang. The other
native soldiers remained loyal and aided in quelling the mutiny. See

to come should oust Spain from her last foothold in the New World.
&lsquo;This new federal republic,&rsquo; wrote Aranda to Floridablanca,
&lsquo;is, so to speak, born a mere pigmy, and has needed the support
of two powerful nations like France and Spain to win its independence.

&ldquo;There was still at Manila another caste of mestizos, originating
from Japanese and the Indian women. These Japanese landed on the island
of Lu&ccedil;on, about fourscore years ago, in a dismantled vessel, and
destitute of everything; I saw them in 1767. They numbered, I believe,
at most sixty or seventy persons, all Christians. But as the form of
government doubtless did not please them, nor perhaps did the
Inquisition, they had demanded to return [to their own country]; and
all, or nearly all, actually departed in that same year, 1767, and

<h2 class="main">THE PHILIPPINES, 1860&ndash;1898&mdash;SOME COMMENT
AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">BY JAMES A. LEROY</p>
<p>The &ldquo;modern era&rdquo; in the Philippine Islands&mdash;which
indeed, in certain respects, did not really begin until after the
establishment of American rule&mdash;coincides roughly with the last
half of the nineteenth century. It is impossible to assign arbitrarily
any date as precisely that of its commencement. One will be inclined to
lay stress upon this or that circumstance, and to choose this or that
date, as he places importance mostly upon matters connected with
economic development, or with social progress, or with political
reforms. The truth is that there was advancement in all these lines, as
also there were hindrances to progress in each of them, and that only
by surveying it in each of these phases of its development can we come
to understand in how considerable a degree Philippine society was
remade during this period.</p>
<p>Looking primarily at the expansion of trade and foreign relations,
we might date the new era in the Philippines from the opening of the
Suez Canal in 1869. Yet that event, while greatly stimulating trade and
agricultural development, did not inaugurate the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>modern era in that respect. The presence of
foreign traders, introducing agricultural machinery and advancing money
on crops, was the chief stimulus to the opening of new areas of
cultivation, the betterment of methods of tilling and preparing crops
for the market, and the consequent growth of exports; indeed, one may
almost say that certain American (United States) and English trading
houses nurtured the sugar and hemp crops of the Philippines into
existence. And their pioneer work in this respect was done before the
opening of the Suez Canal brought the Philippines into vital touch with
Europe by means of steam navigation&mdash;American influence being
then, in fact, already on the wane. One might more readily, from this
point of view, assign importance as a date to 1856, when Iloilo (and
soon after Seb&uacute;) was opened to foreign trade (hitherto confined
to one port of entry, Manila) and foreigners were permitted to open
business houses outside of Manila and to trade and traffic in the
provinces; or, even, to 1859, when the first steam sugar-mill was set
up in Negros island. But the entering wedge had been driven by foreign
traders into Spain&rsquo;s policy of exclusion even before the
cessation of the galleon-trade, the monopoly which confined
Manila&rsquo;s trade to a few Spaniards resident there and their
backers in Mexico, who saw in Manila only a depot of exchange for
Chinese and other Oriental commodities, and commonly despised the idea
of giving any attention to the crude products of the Philippines or
endeavoring to stimulate Philippine agriculture and exportation
properly so called. From the date when this ruinous monopoly expired
with the occupation by Mexican insurgents of Acapulco, the port to
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>the galleons brought their silks, cottons, etc.,
attention was perforce turned upon Philippine products as a source of
trade, and Philippine exports began to grow.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1766src" href="#xd27e1766" name="xd27e1766src">1</a> Spanish
traders being too few, and utterly untrained in the ways of
competition, and Spanish ships being scarce in the Orient, foreign
traders and foreign ships gathered the bulk of the business even in the
face of useless and annoying restrictions, until finally these
foreigners had broken down the barriers sufficiently to enter and take
a hand in actively fostering agricultural development in the
Philippines. Hence, the opening of the Suez Canal only gave a new turn
and a great acceleration to a movement that, as regards Philippine
internal development, may more logically be dated from 1815, the year
of the last voyage of the galleon.</p>
<p>In one sense, indeed, the opening of the Suez Canal tended to
lessen, relatively, the influence of foreign business and banking
houses in the development of the Philippines, in that it led to direct
steamship connection with Spain, awakening interest at home in this
hitherto neglected colony and bringing to the Philippines for the first
time in three hundred years more than a mere handful of Spaniards.
After the early adventurers and encomenderos had disappeared, the
number of Spanish civilians in private life was few indeed, numbering
the favored merchants who had shares in the galleon trade-monopoly, and
an occasional planter, descended perhaps from a family of encomenderos
rooted in the Philippines, or being <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>an ex-army officer
who had remained in the islands. Moreover, the small army maintained in
the islands was to a considerable extent officered by Mexican creoles
or half-castes, its soldiers being mostly Filipinos and Mexicans. The
list of civilian officials was itself small, the governor (alcalde
mayor) of a province combining with his executive functions and (very
commonly) his command of the troops garrisoned therein, the powers of a
superior judge for both civil and criminal jurisdictions. The members
of the religious orders constituted the largest numerically, as well as
the most influential, element of Spaniards in the Philippines. Outside
of this class, the Spanish population of the archipelago, always very
small even in its total, was mostly gathered in a few places, Manila
containing by far the greater proportion. The general rule in the
provinces was that only one white man, the friar-curate, was to be
found in a town, a number of the smaller towns, moreover, not having a
friar-curate, but a Filipino secular priest.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1776src" href="#xd27e1776" name="xd27e1776src">2</a> The movement
of Spaniards to the Philippines <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"
href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>had, indeed, begun before the
opening of the Suez Canal. The inauguration of the Spanish-Philippine
Bank in Manila in 1852 afforded evidence <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>much less, however,
of the growth of Spanish commercial interests than of a desire to
foster the growth of such interests by supplying credit facilities more
nearly up to date than those hitherto available (at ruinous rates of
interest) from the old &ldquo;pious funds&rdquo; [<i lang="es">obras
p&iacute;as</i>] of various sorts, especially since the foreign trading
houses were virtually performing the functions of banks in their ways
of extending credit to agriculturists, or were being aided by private
bankers associated with them.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1819src" href=
"#xd27e1819" name="xd27e1819src">3</a> The loss of Spain&rsquo;s
colonies on the mainland, besides turning many loyal or proscribed
Spaniards toward Cuba and the Peninsula, had in a small degree
encouraged such emigration to the more distant Philippines, and the
history of certain of the most prominent Spanish families in the
Philippines dates from the decades immediately following the political
upheavals in Spanish-America. In the main, however, such immigrants as
came to the Philippines in this way were government employees who,
being ousted from the American continent, must rest as pensioners on
the home government if the latter could not find them places in the
Spanish Antilles or the Philippines. Such immigration, it need not be
said, was not altogether an unmixed good; and some of the various
&ldquo;administrative reforms&rdquo; designed for the Philippines in
the fifties and sixties showed the influence of this pressure to
provide places for officeholders with a claim on the government. The
number of Spaniards who came to the Philippines on their private
initiative was very small until direct <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>steam communication
with the Peninsula was opened, and though it never became large during
the last thirty years of Spanish rule, Spanish commercial interests in
the islands gained relatively on those of foreigners after the opening
of the canal. A direct steamship line from Barcelona was soon
established under subsidy. The domestic shipping laws of Spain were
even more fully extended over the Philippine archipelago, and the
already existing preferential customs duties and regulations aided the
growth of Spanish trade in the islands thereafter more than they had
done before.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1832src" href="#xd27e1832"
name="xd27e1832src">4</a></p>
<p>The opening of the Suez Canal and the entry of Spaniards into the
archipelago in greater numbers marks an epoch even more in a social way
than as respects trade and commerce. And the new social era then
inaugurated was closely allied thenceforward with the discussion of
political reforms, with the essay of some such reforms on the part of
government, and finally with an organized Filipino propaganda for
greater social and political freedom. When the Spanish revolution of
1868 occurred the Philippines were still far remote from the
mother-country, with its disturbing agitations, wherein violence and
utopianism were destined to prepare the way for the reaction; the new
governor-general sent out by the reformers who expelled Isabel II came
to Manila by the Cape of Good Hope, the old voyage which took four
months or more to bring even the news of what was going on in Spain.
The Constitution of 1868 had been proclaimed in the Philippines
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>but a few months back when, early in 1870, the
first steamer arrived direct from Barcelona via Suez. Thenceforward,
the capital of this remote Spanish outpost in the Orient was but one
month distant from Barcelona for mail and passengers; soon after ocean
cables to the ports of China (eventually extended to Manila) put the
Philippines in daily touch, as it were, with important occurrences in
Spain. The old r&eacute;gime of slumbering exclusion, already breaking
down under the influence of trade, was ended.</p>
<p>The influx of Spaniards from this time forward had in it, from the
first to the last, more of &ldquo;politics&rdquo; than of individual
initiative. More of them came out to take governmental positions than
to engage in trade, or, less frequently, in agriculture, though many
who lost their places by changes in administration stayed in the
islands and occupied themselves in private enterprises. It was the
&ldquo;reformers&rdquo; of the revolutionary period in Spain who first
undertook to make a &ldquo;clean sweep&rdquo; of the offices in the
Philippines, putting in their friends. Administrative reforms, and to a
considerable extent a change of officials, was needed; but a more or
less complicated bureaucracy was introduced along with some laudable
reforms, and there was then inaugurated the pernicious custom of
changing the lower Spanish officials in the Philippines, as well as the
higher, with every change of administration in Spain&mdash;the
&ldquo;dance and counter-dance of employees,&rdquo; as one writer has
named it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1841src" href="#xd27e1841" name=
"xd27e1841src">5</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120"
name="pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is undoubtedly some truth in the charge made by the defenders
of the Philippine friars that the entry of Spaniards, especially
officeholders, during the latter part of the nineteenth century lowered
the prestige of the Spanish name in the islands, and was a cause (the
friars would make it the chief or sole cause) of the discontent,
eventually the rebellion, of the Filipinos. Administrative reforms,
some of which were highly beneficial, such as the abolition of the
tobacco monopoly<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1849src" href="#xd27e1849"
name="xd27e1849src">6</a> and the reorganization of provincial
governments, nevertheless had the chief effect, in the eyes of the
Filipinos, of raising direct taxes and of burdening them with the
support of new sets of officeholders, whose presence was not
infrequently distasteful. By far too large a proportion of these
officeholders, who came out to an unhealthful clime to take places
which were miserably paid and might be taken away from them in two or
three years, were concerned rather with the &ldquo;pickings&rdquo; than
with the duties attached to their offices. Some were openly
contemptuous of the natives, and thus helped to destroy the former good
feeling between the races. The grievance of the friars was, however,
far more frequently vented upon a class of Spanish officeholders quite
different from those who gained odium through tyranny or corruption or
both; the special hostility of the friars was visited upon their
countrymen who gained great popularity with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>the
natives, because of their more democratic beliefs and manners. Such men
were commonly of the anti-clerical party in Spain, and the bitterest
element in home politics was thus transferred to the Philippines. One
may recognize that such men were all too commonly quixotic and
indiscreet, as Spanish Liberals notoriously are. To refuse to kiss the
friar&rsquo;s hand, and to speak contemptuously of him and all his kind
(perhaps even to stir up scandal against them), may have seemed to such
men a very natural and proper method of asserting their political
beliefs and their sense of individual independence; yet the friars have
rightly said that such actions, and the many things growing out of
them, struck a blow at the very foundations of the structure upon which
Spanish supremacy had been built in the islands. Hence it was that not
infrequently a more far-seeing Liberal, after some years of experience
in the islands, would come out as a defender of the Philippine friars
and their views as to the political r&eacute;gime to be maintained
there; he would perhaps explain it by saying that he was &ldquo;a
Liberal at home, but in the Philippines all ought to be Spaniards and
only that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even if we give full faith to the complaints of the friars&rsquo;
defenders on this score&mdash;and their representations of the last
half of the nineteenth century are very one-sided&mdash;even if we
admire and accept as truthful the picture they draw of a sort of Eden
in the Philippines back of 1860, and particularly in the two preceding
centuries, wherein the humble Filipino lived practically free of
taxation, exempt from abuses from above, guileless of serious crime,
and watched over by a paternal superior who directed his steps to the
eternal bliss of the other world: still, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>accepting the
friars&rsquo; case at its face value, it is plain that they asked for
and expected the impossible when they fought to perpetuate medieval
conditions in a country opened to trade and commerce and to modern
thought and contact with the world at large. We may doubt that
ignorance was bliss even in the &ldquo;good old days;&rdquo; but it was
certain that those days must come to an end when the Philippines were
awakened by steamships, telegraph lines, newspapers, and books (even
though under clerical and political censorship). Clear-sighted prophecy
was that of Feodor Jagor, the German scientist who traveled through the
Philippines just before 1860, and who, though he found much to praise
in the old paternal r&eacute;gime, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old situation is no longer possible of maintenance, with
the changed conditions of the present time. The colony can no longer be
shut off from the outside. Every facility in communication opens a
breach in the ancient system and necessarily leads to reforms of a
liberal character. The more that foreign capital and foreign ideas
penetrate there, the more they increase prosperity, intelligence, and
self-esteem, making the existing evils the more
intolerable.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1865src" href=
"#xd27e1865" name="xd27e1865src">7</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>The echoes of Spanish partisanship and the talk of
nineteenth-century reforms had been heard in the Philippines before the
revolution of 1868 and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>opening of the Suez Canal, though
it was only after these events that the people generally began to be
stirred, and then only in the most populous districts. Because the
clerical influence was all-powerful anyway, and the whole fabric of
Philippine government reposed upon it, Carlism was felt in the islands
before 1850 rather as an influence in certain military mutinies and as
a source of strife between rival sets of civil officials than as
involving primarily a defense of ecclesiastical privilege. Foremost
among the events of the decade preceding the revolution of 1868 may be
put the return of the Jesuits to the islands in 1859 (allowed by decree
of 1852) and the beginning of educational reform with the decrees of
1863 ordering the establishment of a normal school and of primary
schools under government control and supported directly by the local
governments.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1888src" href="#xd27e1888"
name="xd27e1888src">8</a> The Jesuits had already opened a secondary
school in Manila, introducing for the first time something besides
merely theoretical instruction in natural sciences, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>and
more modern methods of instruction generally. Their secondary school
was subsidized by the city government of Manila, their meteorological
observatory was subsidized by the insular government, which also
employed them to inaugurate and conduct the new normal school.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1898src" href="#xd27e1898" name="xd27e1898src">9</a>
From this time forward the Society was both directly and indirectly a
stimulus to educational progress in the Philippines, was influential
both in diffusing more generally primary instruction and in improving
methods and widening curriculums of higher instruction. In a large
degree, the educational program remained to the end of Spanish rule a
pretentious but most superficial thing, more sounding brass than solid
achievement. But we may fairly date a new epoch in this respect from
the return of the Jesuits and the decrees of 1863.</p>
<p>In another way the return of the Jesuits is to be associated with
the beginning of a new era in the islands. They were not permitted to
resume the parochial benefices which their order had held prior
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>to their expulsion in 1768, but were to engage
in missions in Mindanao and in educational and scientific work. Their
resumption of the old missions in Mindanao was accomplished at the
expense of the order of Recollects, which was thereupon given the
provision of certain parishes, including several wealthy parishes in
Luzon, which had for greater or less intervals been held by the more
prominent and able of the secular priests, Filipinos of pure native
blood or half-castes.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1911src" href=
"#xd27e1911" name="xd27e1911src">10</a> The cabildo of the Manila
cathedral, including the more notable of the secular priests, and the
curates of the few conspicuous parishes (in central Luzon) which it
fell to the lot of the secular clergy to occupy, had come to regard
these benefices as their property, in a &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; sense,
as it were, quite as each religious order felt that certain parishes,
or whole provinces &ldquo;belonged&rdquo; to it as an order. It is
significant that here, for the first time, one notes a feeling of
solidarity among the Filipino secular clergy&mdash;for the
demonstration of which feeling one has looked in vain, except in
isolated cases, prior to that time, above all in connection with the
effort (1770) of the Spanish archbishop Santa Justa y Rufina, to
secularize the parishes and displace the friars with native priests.
Only the bolder of the Filipino priests expressed the complaints of
their fellows, even now, and open talk of a campaign for secularization
of all the parishes was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>scarcely heard until some courage
was infused into these few and the small party of Filipino Liberals
(mostly half-castes or Spaniards of Philippine birth) after the
revolution of 1868 and the arrival of a governor-general who permitted
public demonstrations in behalf of Liberal reforms. From the time of
the execution of three Filipino priests for alleged complicity in the
Cavite mutiny of 1872<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1921src" href=
"#xd27e1921" name="xd27e1921src">11</a>&mdash;the proofs of whose guilt
the public has not seen, if the military courts which tried them
did&mdash;there was added to the campaign for the expulsion of the
friars<a class="noteref" id="xd27e1929src" href="#xd27e1929" name=
"xd27e1929src">12</a> on account of their landed estates and of their
stifling of intellectual freedom the demand that Philippine parishes be
entrusted to a native priesthood. Only since American occupation has
the demand for a <i>national</i> clergy found full expression, but it
had for a quarter of a century before that been an important phase of
the sentiment of nationality, a sentiment that was growing steadily,
though slowly and in the main secretly until 1896 in the Tag&aacute;log
provinces and 1898 in the archipelago at large.</p>
<p>The reactionary party had partially regained the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>upper hand when the mutiny occurred in Cavite in
1872. Instead of treating it as its comparative insignificance
demanded, and as prudent statecraft would have counseled, they employed
it as an excuse for vengeful violence, as a means for resuming full
control of Philippine policy, and continued for twenty-five years
thereafter to point to it as their most useful &ldquo;horrible
example,&rdquo; as an evidence of what must follow the inauguration,
even in the slightest degree, of a liberal policy in the government of
the islands. Rightly or wrongly, the people of that and the succeeding
generation in the Tag&aacute;log provinces, and to a less degree in the
others, were schooled in racial resentment through the belief that the
native priests had been done to death, upon a pretext of manufactured
evidence, by the malevolence of the friars. The proscription of the
more conspicuous of the then small Liberal element among the Filipinos
had consequences of no less importance. Those who were sent into exile
for alleged complicity in the Cavite mutiny were certain conspicuous
half-castes and a few Spaniards of Philippine birth or of long
residence in the islands. The native element proper was for the moment
scarcely affected, even in Manila and its environs; and no one has ever
demonstrated that the few more advanced men of Spanish blood who were
moved by the revolution in Spain to take a stand for Liberal measures
in the Philippines were engaged in anything but legitimate political
discussion, or indeed that they talked of going so far in this
direction in the Philippines as had already been done in the Peninsula.
These proscriptions powerfully stimulated the idea of a &ldquo;Filipino
cause.&rdquo; Some of the exiles escaped to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>Hongkong, and there founded a Filipino colony.
Others settled eventually in Europe; the more progressive and ambitious
Filipinos began sending their sons to Madrid and Paris for education in
contact with the thought of modern Europe; and in these capitals, and
later in Japan, little Filipino colonies became centers of discussion
of political reforms, and through letters, publications in the Liberal
periodicals of Spain, and finally through their own books and
periodicals of propaganda, greatly influenced the growth of a public
opinion in the backward society of the Philippines. Spanish Masonry
gradually extended the circle of its initiations and of its secret
operations (necessarily secret to an extraordinary degree) in the
islands. At first only Spaniards had been admitted to a few lodges,
then mestizos were admitted, and finally natives of some degree of
education without regard to race. In the eighties and nineties, there
seems to be no doubt, a sort of independent Grand Lodge in Spain
(asserted by some to be of spurious Masonry),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1947src" href="#xd27e1947" name="xd27e1947src">13</a> managed by
zealous Liberal propagandists with whom certain of the Filipino
propagandists in Barcelona had associated themselves, directed the
active organization of lodges in as many Filipino towns as contained
favorable material, for the purpose of fostering in the islands a
demand for political reforms, of distributing the literature of the
propaganda, and of collecting funds to support the campaign in Spain
for the extension of greater social, political, and religious freedom
to the Filipinos. The Spaniards associated with this movement were for
the most part men of no standing and quixotic visionaries. Some of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>Filipinos who figured in the propaganda abroad
were quite as unpractical, being inexperienced and excitable youths,
full of jealousy of each other, while some few of them, moreover,
misused the funds raised for them by their fellows at home. The whole
program for &ldquo;assimilation&rdquo; of the Philippines to Spain as a
province of the Peninsula, giving a distant archipelago in the Orient
with its widely different population, social status, and economic
conditions and needs, a government just like that of European Spain was
manifestly absurd and inimical to the interests of the Filipinos
themselves, not to add that its realization was an utter impossibility.
But these things should not have been allowed to hide the justice of
the demand for such reforms and privileges as were practical and
compatible with the needs and conditions of the archipelago and its
people: for a spokesman or spokesmen of the Philippines in the Cortes
at Madrid; for reforms in judiciary and fundamental laws, not blindly
copied from those promulgated in Spain but adapted to the Philippines,
or if necessary especially drafted for them; for administrative
reforms, above all as to the civil service and looking toward an
increasing recognition of the native element in government, and toward
a decentralization that should be gradually extended as far as deeply
rooted habits and long-standing customs would permit; and, finally, for
greater individual and social freedom, both in a political and a
religious sense. This last was really the crux of the whole situation,
so far as the continuance of Spanish sovereignty should not come to
depend purely on force. In the old days it had rested on religious
teachings, on the friars in fact, with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>sense of race-prestige in the background to
support Spanish authority. It was futile for the friars to cry out for
a return to the old conditions, and to denounce as dangerous any
reforms in the direction of freedom of thought or of speech; the pages
of history could not be turned back. The idea of future independence
from Spain was, to be sure, in the minds of some at least of the
Filipino propagandists. But their present campaign was for greater
political liberty, and the measures they advocated, and even the
methods they employed almost to the last, would have been legitimate in
any free country&mdash;were, in fact, legitimate even then in the
Peninsula itself, where they could advocate publicly what they must
whisper among their fellows at home. The very fact that such
organizations as these spurious Masonic lodges were under the ban, and
that even to be suspected of belonging thereto was to invite the danger
of deportation from home as a &ldquo;conspirator,&rdquo; is sufficient
proof of the essential righteousness of the propagandists&rsquo; cause.
And the campaign that began with a few Spanish-Filipinos in Manila and
gradually extended to the more independent men of education in the
provinces eventually, under half-educated leaders of the small middle
class, reached in a perverted form the masses themselves, especially in
central Luzon, and found expression at last in violence and an outburst
of race-hatred. The Katipunan was not Masonic, as the friars asserted,
only copying some of the Masonic formul&aelig;; but it was a natural
and logical outgrowth of the smothering of what had been a legitimate
movement for the expression of Filipino reform sentiment. <span class=

<p>The title to these notes has indicated the year 1860 as marking in a
general way the opening of the modern era in the Philippines, without
reference to any one particular event. It is proposed to give here,
briefly, such further notes as will afford a working bibliography on
this period, while calling attention to some subjects and certain
points that are commonly disregarded in the bibliographies and
published works dealing with the last years of Spanish rule in the
Philippines. No pretense to completeness is made. The aim is to call
attention, under their proper heads, to the more distinctly useful (or,
in some cases, the more unreliable, and hence to be avoided) titles
already listed in the Philippine bibliography that is to be most
readily obtained, and which is also the most complete and satisfactory
work of this sort, viz., that published at Washington in 1903;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e1963src" href="#xd27e1963" name=
"xd27e1963src">14</a> and also to supplement these titles with others
there unnoticed and with other data not easily found. In the main, only
such works are cited as the writer has himself consulted, though in
some cases the notes or recommendations of others have been
followed.</p>
<p>The first essential to a study of this period is a fair and
comprehensive survey of Philippine conditions in the years just
preceding&mdash;the &ldquo;old r&eacute;gime,&rdquo; as we may call it,
though it was then breaking down in certain particulars. One book alone
will serve the student&rsquo;s purpose in this respect; and, whatever
others <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>are read, Jagor&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e1981src" href="#xd27e1981" name="xd27e1981src">15</a> is
indispensable. Next to him, and in addition to the documents appearing
in this series immediately preceding the present volume may be cited
the 1842 <i lang="es">Informe</i> of the Spanish diplomat in the
Orient, Sinibaldo de Mas, and the two-volume treatise of 1846 by the
Frenchman, J. Mallat. In certain respects, the latter has closely
followed Mas; but his is no mere translated plagiarism, like that of
John Bowring (1859), who was only a temporary visitor entertained by
Spanish officialdom in Manila. The work of Paul de la Gironi&egrave;re,
not his <i>Twenty Years in the Philippines</i>, but his more serious
work of 1855 (<i lang="fr">Aventures d&rsquo;un gentilhomme breton aux
&icirc;les Philippines</i>), merits attention as containing the
observations of a cultivated foreigner who had the advantage of years
of residence in Manila and a neighboring province.</p>
<p>As was indicated at the beginning of these notes, to make a thorough
study of this period, we should consider it under three heads, viz.,
economic development, social development, and political development.
Not only has there been no comprehensive review of the period as a
whole, but there exists no review of it under any one of these heads,
nor even any group of writings which can be offered to the inquirer as
covering the field of inquiry in any one of these respects. For one
thing, we must draw mainly upon Spanish sources of information,
official and private, and rare indeed is the Spanish writer
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>who does not either proceed regardless of the
economic point of view, or else give entirely secondary consideration
to the vital matter concerned in the economic and social progress of a
people independently of political forms and governmental influences.
The result is that Spanish writers, with them the Filipinos, and to a
great extent the writers of Philippine treatises in other languages
(drawing hastily upon Spanish sources), have over-emphasized the
political history of this Philippine period. Of course, in Spain and
the Spanish countries long-standing habit makes it the tendency to look
to government for everything, and to think of all amelioration of evils
and all incitements to progress as coming from above; while social and
economic conditions in the Philippines are such as to emphasize this
tendency, the aristocracy of wealth and education standing apart from
the masses and being, to the latter, identified in the main with the
government, with the &ldquo;powers above.&rdquo; Nevertheless, it is to
be insisted that social and economic progress in the Philippines during
the last half-century should be considered separately and studied more
particularly than they have been thus far.</p>
<p>It need hardly be said, for another thing, that it is not possible
to make an absolute separation of this subject under the headings thus
indicated. Such a thing cannot be done with any people in any period of
history. In this particular case, one need only mention the Religious
Question, with its phases as a contest between friars and native
clergy, as a demand for modern freedom of thought and speech, and as an
agrarian question, to show at once that matters social, economic, and
political are here interwoven. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>So also the Spanish
administration cannot be considered wholly apart from its bearing upon
economic and social as well as purely political matters. No rigid
classification is possible, but the student who approaches the history
of this period&mdash;which, apart from its own interest, has had ever
since 1898 the most vital bearing upon a public question of great
importance in the United States today&mdash;will avoid confusion by
giving consideration to these separate points of view.</p>

<h3 class="main">SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One would welcome an attempt by some one of the more
ambitious Filipino writers and students whose attention has been
occupied almost exclusively with political controversy to write the
social history of his people during this last period of Spanish rule.
The materials for such a study, so far as they now exist in print, are
very fragmentary, and the work could hardly be well done by any but a
resident of the islands during that period. But few references need be
given here, and the inquirer must derive most of his information on
this line from the numerous books and pamphlets whose object is
primarily political questions and from the economic and fiscal tables
and studies which shed light upon the general status of the people.</p>
<p>General historical surveys of the period are lacking. Montero y
Vidal&rsquo;s three-volume history comes down only to 1873. And, though
it is the best Philippine historical work for reference purposes, it
is, after all, hardly more than a chronology of important events and
compilation of official orders and projects, touching the life of the
people scarcely at all. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href=
"#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>same author&rsquo;s work of 1886,
<i lang="es">El archipi&eacute;lago filipino</i>, merits attention also
in this connection, though primarily it sets forth facts geographical,
statistical, etc. The works of Manuel Scheidnagel deserve also citation
as those of a Spanish official of long and varied experience in the
Philippines, and as shedding, incidentally to the particular subjects
which they treat, light upon the conditions of country and people in
general.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2016src" href="#xd27e2016" name=
"xd27e2016src">16</a></p>
<p>The foreigners who traveled in the Philippines during this period,
and who have written thereon, were occupied in most cases with
scientific pursuits, and have confined themselves mainly to these
objects in what they have published. The <i lang="fr">Lu&ccedil;on et
Palaouan</i> (Paris, 1887) of Alfred Marche touches upon the customs
and conditions of the people in its record of six years&rsquo;
scientific research for the government of France. Edmond
Plauchut&rsquo;s contributions to the <i lang="fr">Revue des deux
mondes</i> for 1869 and 1877, in lighter vein and perhaps not always
accurate, are, like Gironi&egrave;re&rsquo;s writings of earlier date,
interesting as presenting the observations of a resident foreigner.
Among the works in English, revised or written since 1898 to meet the
demand in the United States for information about the Philippines, Dean
C. Worcester&rsquo;s <i>The Philippine Islands and their People</i>
(New York, 1898), brings us nearest to the life of the people,
particularly in the rural districts and regions most remote from modern
changing influences. The treatises of the British engineers and experts
in tropical agriculture, Frederick H. Sawyer and John Foreman, are
written by men who were, naturally, best prepared <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>to
discuss the agricultural conditions and the material resources in
general of the Philippines. Outside of these matters, except when
reciting personal experiences and observations, both are compilers
whose reading in Philippine bibliography has been very fragmentary.
Foreman in particular has undertaken to cover the entire field of
Philippine history and politics, and has, to state the plain truth,
made a very bad botch of it. He has been so often quoted in the United
States as authority for erroneous statements that it is time to make
this fact clear. It is commonly impossible to draw the line in what he
has written between fact and gossip, conjecture, or partial truth. His
latest edition (1906) contains most of the old glaring errors or even
worse omissions, with a full measure of new ones in his recital of the
history of events since 1896. Some data contained in Foreman&rsquo;s
book are not readily available to an American student outside of the
large libraries; but a caution is to be uttered against relying upon
him, even for his recital of fiscal details or for his statistical
tables. Sawyer is very much more accurate and reliable, just as he is
less pretentious in the program of his work.</p>
<p>In studying the social process of the Filipino people from about
1860 onward, the subject of education holds the first place.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2037src" href="#xd27e2037" name=
"xd27e2037src">17</a> It is, however, unnecessary to occupy ourselves
here with the bibliography of the subject, which has been very fully
covered in <span class="sc">VOLS.</span> <span class="sc">XLV</span>
and <span class="sc">XLVI</span> of this work, the appendices to those
volumes giving, in connection with other documents <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>in
this series and with the bibliographical notes, the most comprehensive
treatment of the subject of education in the Philippines that is yet
available in any language.</p>
<p>As we might expect from what has been said, the social life of the
Philippines, at least from about 1875, may best be studied in the
periodicals of Manila. In this connection it is only necessary to
mention Retana&rsquo;s <i lang="es">El periodismo filipino</i>, which
covers the subject down to 1894. <i lang="es">La Revista de
Filipinas</i>, edited by J. F. del Pan, 1875&ndash;77, deserves special
mention among the many periodicals of short life. Among those of longer
duration may be named <i lang="es">El Diario de Manila</i>, and also,
for the closing years of Spanish rule, <span class="sc">La
Ocean&iacute;a Espa&ntilde;ola</span>, <i lang="es">La Voz
Espa&ntilde;ola</i> and <i lang="es">El Comercio</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2072src" href="#xd27e2072" name="xd27e2072src">18</a> One
should also consult these Spanish periodicals of Manila for the
political history of these years, particularly of 1896&ndash;98. It
must be remarked, however, that, just as these periodicals reflected
mainly the life only of the capital, and that quite exclusively from
the Spanish viewpoint, so also they treated political and
administrative matters not merely under the constraint of their
editors&rsquo; notions as to &ldquo;maintaining Spanish prestige&rdquo;
but also with a censorship in the background, maintained by and for the
political and the ecclesiastical authorities.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2101src" href="#xd27e2101" name="xd27e2101src">19</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>Down to 1898 the Philippine law of censorship of
1857, modeled on that of Spain in the days of Isabel II, was in force,
and it covered the publication of books and pamphlets of all sorts and
of newspapers, the importation and sale of books, pictures, etc., and
the regulation of theaters.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2111src" href=
"#xd27e2111" name="xd27e2111src">20</a> One will, therefore, look
almost in vain in these periodicals prior to 1898 for expressions of
the Filipino point of view, or, till the close of 1897, for any frank
expression of liberal political views on the part of Spanish editors.
The few Manila periodicals started by Filipinos before 1898, usually
printed in Spanish and Tag&aacute;log, had but an ephemeral
existence.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2120src" href="#xd27e2120" name=
"xd27e2120src">21</a> One must look for the expression of Filipino aims
and ideas to the periodicals that have been published since 1898;
indeed, even the Spanish press of Manila has treated Filipino questions
with freedom only since American occupation began.</p>
<p>For population statistics, all practical purposes are served by the
tables and comparisons of the American census of 1903.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e2125src" href="#xd27e2125" name=
"xd27e2125src">22</a> Here one may find also the best data for
reconstructing before his eyes the social and economic status of the
Philippines and its inhabitants at the close of Spanish rule. The
Spanish civil census of 1896 was unfortunately never published, nor
completed in some provinces. The civil <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>census of 1887,
though published in very condensed form, merits attention.<a class=

<p class="first">Using, as throughout these notes, the
<i>Bibliography</i> as a starting point, the student is referred to the
first part of that work, viz., the <i>List</i> of the Library of
Congress, under the headings Agriculture, Commerce, Finance, and
Political and Social Economy; and to Pardo de Tavera&rsquo;s <i lang=
"es">Biblioteca</i> under the alphabetical lists of Aranceles,
Balanzas, Bolet&iacute;n, Estatutos, Exposici&oacute;n, Gu&iacute;a,
Instrucci&oacute;n, Memoria, and Reglamentos. Some of the works therein
cited are obviously indispensable, and occasional biographical and
bibliographical notes are also afforded, especially by Pardo de Tavera
under the names of authors cited, which will help in forming an opinion
on the value of their works.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2163src" href=
"#xd27e2163" name="xd27e2163src">25</a> It is in point here to
designate among these works those most useful as references in a
general way upon Philippine economic <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>matters, to add some
not listed in the <i>Bibliography</i>, and to give some special
references under the particular headings of Agriculture, Commerce, and
Industry.</p>
<p><i>General.</i>&mdash;Jagor&rsquo;s book, already noted as the best
introduction to the study of this period, is again mentioned here as
affording data on the tobacco monopoly (which lasted until 1884, before
its affairs were wound up), the attitude of the Spaniards toward the
entry of foreign traders, and the part these foreigners played in
developing the culture of <i>abak&aacute;</i> and sugar. Cavada&rsquo;s
<i lang="es">Historia geogr&aacute;fica, geol&oacute;gica y
estad&iacute;stica de Filipinas</i> (Manila, 1876) has a good arsenal
of data drawn chiefly from the civil statistical inquiries of 1870,
though, like almost all such works in Spanish, it is without a topical
index and is put together in a disorderly manner most exasperating to
the searcher for facts or figures on a specific point of inquiry. Of
the works of Jos&eacute; Jimeno y Agius, his <i lang="es">Memoria sobre
el desestanco del tabaco</i> (Binondo, 1871) and <i lang=
"es">Poblaci&oacute;n y comercio de las islas Filipinas</i> (Madrid,
1884) should be especially mentioned. Gregorio Sancianco y
Goson&rsquo;s <i lang="es">El progreso de Filipinas</i> (Madrid, 1881),
especially valuable on administrative matters just prior to the
revision of the fiscal r&eacute;gime in connection with the abolition
of the government tobacco monopoly, has also many data on land,
commerce, and industry. Scattered through the eight volumes of the
fortnightly <i lang="es">La Pol&iacute;tica de Espa&ntilde;a en
Filipinas</i> (Madrid, 1891&ndash;98) are useful items on Philippine
currency and exchange, trade, etc., with occasional studies of these
questions and those of Chinese and European immigration, in most cases
hasty, unreliable pieces of work, often even <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>fantastic for their utter disregard of the
fundamentals of political economy. Foreman&rsquo;s book has already
been characterized; nevertheless, checked up with Sawyer&rsquo;s, it is
of use in this connection. Of the consular and other official reports,
those of the British Foreign Office<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2199src"
href="#xd27e2199" name="xd27e2199src">26</a> are the most valuable as a
series, though the comprehensive reports of the French Consul, M. de
B&eacute;rard, covering the years 1888&ndash;92, merit first place as
individual treatises.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2205src" href=
"#xd27e2205" name="xd27e2205src">27</a></p>
<p>The testimony and memoranda presented before the American Peace
Commission in Paris in 1898, together with some magazine articles on
the Philippines, form appendices to <i>Senate Document no. 62</i>, 55th
Congress, 3rd session; only the memorandum of General F. V. Greene (pp.
404&ndash;440) and Max L. Tornow&rsquo;s <i>Sketch of the Economic
Conditions of the Philippines</i> require any consideration in this
connection.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2222src" href="#xd27e2222" name=
"xd27e2222src">28</a> The reports on civil affairs (1899&ndash;1901) of
the United States military government in the Philippines and the
reports of the Philippine Commission have much retrospective value in
connection with the previous economic and fiscal r&eacute;gime, and
merit a general perusal in that light; some of their more <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>especially pertinent revelations will be
hereinafter cited. The <i>Report on Certain Economic Questions in the
English and Dutch Colonies in the Orient</i> (Washington, 1902) by
Jeremiah W. Jenks, special commissioner of the United States
government, is of course of comparative value primarily, but contains
some general remarks on Philippine conditions as regards currency,
labor, land, and taxation. In many respects the best economic study
ever made of the Philippines is Victor S. Clark&rsquo;s <i>Labor
Conditions in the Philippines</i> (Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor no.
58, Washington, May, 1905); though discussing the labor question, and
that under American occupation, it has been written with a view
constantly to past conditions in the Philippines, social and political
as well as economic.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2240src" href=
"#xd27e2240" name="xd27e2240src">29</a></p>
<p><i>Agriculture, Land, etc.</i>&mdash;Beyond the general references
given, no special work can be recommended on the subject of Philippine
agriculture. The reports and bulletins of the present Philippine Bureau
of Agriculture (1902 to date) shed much light incidentally on past
conditions and methods of cultivation. Numerous official provisions and
some private treatises on the Spanish land laws are cited by Pardo de
Tavera; but these remained for the most part dead letters, and for all
practical purposes a little compilation in English<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e2253src" href="#xd27e2253" name="xd27e2253src">30</a> by the
present Philippine Forestry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>Bureau suffices. In a report on
the establishment of land banks in the Philippines, Jos&eacute; Cabezas
de Herrera provided a historical review and abstract of landed property
in those islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2267src" href="#xd27e2267"
name="xd27e2267src">31</a> In connection with his arguments in behalf
of a tax on landed property as just and as also necessary in order to
support a really efficient government in the Philippines, Sancianco y
Goson gives considerable information on conditions of land tenure and
cultivation down to 1881.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2279src" href=
"#xd27e2279" name="xd27e2279src">32</a></p>
<p><i>Chinese.</i>&mdash;Discussion of the Chinese in the Philippines
is related more particularly to questions of industry and retail trade.
Nevertheless, the Spanish government maintained almost to the end the
theory&mdash;it was hardly more than an empty theory&mdash;that the
Chinese immigration was being so regulated as to constitute a stimulus
to agriculture. The subject also falls into place here because, from
about 1886, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145"
name="pb145">145</a>]</span>a campaign for the exclusion of the Chinese
was started by Spanish merchants and newspaper men, a program for
fostering the immigration of Spaniards into the Philippines, and
especially into the undeveloped areas of Mindanao and Palawan, was
quite regularly coupled with the arguments for Chinese exclusion. This
program was usually presented without regard for the climatic and
economic considerations involved; that it was a &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo;
scheme was sufficient for some of these writers, who never stopped to
ask themselves if their plans were practical.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2291src" href="#xd27e2291" name="xd27e2291src">33</a> Among the
pamphlets on the Chinese in the Philippines cited by Pardo de Tavera,
those of Del Pan and Jordana y Morera deserve attention. A good survey
of the subject, though not accurate in its statistics, is G.
Garc&iacute;a Ageo&rsquo;s <i>Memorandum on the Chinese in the
Philippines</i> in <i>Report of the Philippine Commission, 1900</i>,
ii, pp. 432&ndash;445.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2306src" href=
"#xd27e2306" name="xd27e2306src">34</a></p>
<p><i>Industries.</i>&mdash;The general references already cited must
be relied upon, and it is a rather wearisome task to uncover the data
for a study of Philippine industries from statistical tables, treatises
and pamphlets which have given the subject a cursory or fragmentary
treatment. The British and French consular reports may, however, be
especially remarked. Also, the reports of the Chief of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue in the reports of the Philippine Commission since
1904, when a new scheme of internal taxation was adopted, contain much
information on industrial conditions, past and present. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Commerce, Internal Trade, Navigation, etc.</i>&mdash;The Spanish
statistical annuals, tariff regulations, etc., are fully listed by the
Library of Congress and Pardo de Tavera, under the headings above noted
for general references on economic matters. The most comprehensive
survey of trade statistics, and one which almost serves the purpose by
itself alone, is contained in the <i>Monthly Summary of Commerce of the
Philippine Islands</i>, for December, 1904, published at Washington by
the Bureau of Insular Affairs. It presents classified tables covering
Philippine imports and exports for the fifty years 1855&ndash;1904;
they were prepared from the best available Spanish trade statistics,
reduced to terms of American gold currency at the average rate of
exchange for each year, and, so far as the writer has checked these
figures, they are the most reliable that are presented
anywhere.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2324src" href="#xd27e2324" name=
"xd27e2324src">35</a> Among the very few Spanish writings,
Azc&aacute;rraga&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Libertad de Comercio</i> (Madrid,
1872) and Jimeno Agius&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Poblaci&oacute;n y
comercio</i> (1884) deserve special mention, also once more the useful
little book of Sancianco y Goson, for brief but useful data for
1868&ndash;80 in its appendices.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2339src"
href="#xd27e2339" name="xd27e2339src">36</a> For 1891&ndash;98,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span><i lang="es">La Pol&iacute;tica de Espa&ntilde;a
en Filipinas</i> has some scattering figures on trade and commerce,
year by year, highly unsatisfactory for the most part. Besides the
general references upon the Spanish customs tariffs, one will find in
<i>Senate Document no. 134</i>, 57th Congress, 1st session (Washington,
1902), in its Exhibit D, a comparison of the 1901 tariff with the
Spanish tariff of 1891.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2352src" href=
"#xd27e2352" name="xd27e2352src">37</a></p>
<p><i>Currency.</i>&mdash;The <i>List</i> of the Library of Congress,
under the heading Finance, cites a few Spanish and foreign treatises on
Philippine currency prior to 1898, and the earlier American official
reports on the subject. One will get more enlightenment upon the actual
conditions prevailing during the last years of Spanish rule from
memoranda and testimony in certain of these American reports than from
any of the printed sources of date earlier than 1898. Nevertheless, the
petition of the Manila Chamber of Commerce in 1895 reproduced in
<i lang="es">La Pol&iacute;tica de Espa&ntilde;a en Filipinas</i>, v,
no. 105, brings out in part the highly unsatisfactory conditions
produced by the Spanish government&rsquo;s inaction and disregard of
well-established economic principles. In <i>ibid.</i>, vii, p. 217, is
given the text of the decree of April 17, 1897, providing for the new
Philippine silver peso which was beginning to circulate in the islands
when American arms intervened, and which was proclaimed as a
&ldquo;settlement&rdquo; of the Philippine currency evils, yet would
obviously not have proved sufficient, unsupported as it was by
provisions to sustain it in the face of the decline of silver. In much
of the loose talk about economic depression in the Philippines
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>since the wars of 1896&ndash;98 and
1899&ndash;1901, not enough attention has been paid to the fact that
&ldquo;hard times&rdquo; had really begun before, during 1891&ndash;95
particularly, and that an unstable currency and exchange fluctuations
had then played their part in producing these conditions; also that it
was the Filipino laborer and small producer who was especially mulcted
of his due by conditions produced in part officially and in part by
governmental neglect.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2370src" href=
"#xd27e2370" name="xd27e2370src">38</a> In addition to the American
documents listed by the Library of Congress, reference should be made,
as regards currency and exchange evils before 1898, to the survey of
the subject by the Schurman Commission (<i>Report of the Philippine
Commission, 1900</i>, i, pp. 142&ndash;149), and the testimony of
Manila bankers and business men in the same report (vol. ii); to
magazine articles by Charles A. Conant printed as appendices in
<i>Report of the Commission on International Exchange</i> (Washington,
1903); and, for a few details on previous conditions, with exchange
tables, to the reports of E. W. Kemmerer, Chief of the Division of
Currency, for 1904 and 1905.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2380src" href=

ADMINISTRATION</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Our object here being primarily the political progress
of the Filipino people, we are concerned incidentally, as it were, with
the subject of Spanish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>administration considered by
itself alone. A good study of that subject, be it said, is lacking, and
it may be recommended as an opportunity worth improving.</p>
<p>No one who has read even a little about the Philippines and
Filipinos need be told that it is necessary to trace the political
development of this people along two lines&mdash;unfortunately, it
proved for Spain, lines that are divergent in considerable degree.
Hence the subdivision of this heading, regarding, first, development
under Spanish Administration and then the Filipino Propaganda, first of
Reform and finally of Revolution. We are concerned in the first
instance, that is, with reforms and progress realized in consequence of
measures &ldquo;from above.&rdquo; It has already been said that very
considerable progress had been made by the Spanish government from
about 1860 onward, and was being made when the Tag&aacute;logs appealed
to arms in 1896.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2398src" href="#xd27e2398"
name="xd27e2398src">40</a> It is also true that the stimulus to the
Filipino reform propaganda came in considerable degree from the
movements toward betterment of the government itself, and from the
agitations for reform in Spanish home politics.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2404src" href="#xd27e2404" name="xd27e2404src">41</a> But the
development of the Filipino people, social, political, and economic,
proceeded at last more rapidly, or less haltingly at least, than the
progress in reform from above; the reform measures were only partial,
often unpractical or ill-adapted to Philippine conditions; abuses of
administration continued under so-called <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>Liberal periods as
well as in times of full clerical domination; in the action and
reaction of Spanish politics, in which so often are party divisions
merely nominal and superficial, the course of progress was so irregular
and uncertain as to lend justification to the feeling of the Filipinos
that they were being treated with insincerity; and all the while, in
the midst of bitter partisan and religious controversy, conducted on
both sides by writers most rabid and intemperate, the two peoples were
constantly growing apart from each other, and were losing the mutual
good-feeling of past years which, though always superficial in large
part (as in any such domination of one race by another), had
nevertheless had a foundation of genuine esteem.</p>
<p><i>The administrative organism.</i>&mdash;For present purposes, it
almost suffices to refer simply to the <i>List</i> of the Library of
Congress under the headings Finance, Law, Political and Social Economy,
and to Pardo de Tavera&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Biblioteca</i> under the
names of authors cited in the above <i>List</i> and the alphabetical
headings Aranceles, Balanza, Bolet&iacute;n, Colecci&oacute;n,
Disposiciones, Exposici&oacute;n, Gu&iacute;a, Memoria, Proyectos
(those of 1870 for all sorts of reforms proposed after the Spanish
Revolution of 1868), and Reglamentos. The bibliography of Colonization
published by the Library of Congress, besides these special works on
the Philippines, lists also works on Spanish colonies and works on
colonization in general.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2422src" href=
"#xd27e2422" name="xd27e2422src">42</a> Of the compilations,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>annuals, etc., listed in these bibliographies,
special attention may be directed to those cited under the names of
Rodriguez San Pedro (to 1869) and Rodriguez Berriz (to 1888). The most
complete reference work on Spanish legislation, executive regulations,
etc., is the <i lang="es">Colecci&oacute;n legislativa de
Espa&ntilde;a</i>, and this work contains provisions enacted at Madrid
with regard to the Philippines down to and including 1898. For the full
official record, not only of enactments at Madrid, but of the forms
under which these were carried into effect in the islands themselves,
the Philippine governmental regulations, proclamations, etc., covering
this entire period down to the end of Spanish rule, the official
gazette of the Philippines (published under the name <i lang="es">La
Gaceta de Manila</i>, 1860&ndash;1898) is the final source; but the
writer knows of no full collection thereof in any library of the United
States, though there is of course one in the archives at Manila. In
this connection, it should be remarked that the governor-general had
very wide, and in some respects not very exactly prescribed, powers,
one of the most indefinite and sweeping of which was that requiring any
general law or special provision of Madrid, before it actually acquired
force in the Philippines, to be published with the
governor-general&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i lang="es">c&uacute;mplase</i>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;let it go into effect&rdquo;). This might be, and usually was,
a mere formality; but it was capable of being used so as at least to
postpone the execution of a legislative decree or ministerial order
which was distasteful to the chief authority of the Philippines, was
violently opposed by the influential interests in the islands
(particularly the ecclesiastical element), or, as happened in some
cases, was manifestly inapplicable to Philippine conditions.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>Of course, the governor-general could readily be
overruled, but even so, he could, if he desired, secure thus a delay
and possible reconsideration of the matter, and the frequent changes of
party administration in Spain encouraged delays of this and like sorts,
not a few reform decrees remaining thus dead letters in the
Philippines. It is often important, therefore, to discover not only
what was the law or regulation provided for the Philippines in Madrid,
but how it was put into force in the islands, or if it actually took
effect at all. For this purpose, the Official Guide of the Philippines
(<i lang="es">Gu&iacute;a de forasteros</i> to 1865, <i lang=
"es">Gu&iacute;a oficial</i> from 1879 to 1898) supplements in some
respects the official gazette and the collection of Rodriguez
Berriz.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2454src" href="#xd27e2454" name=

<p><i>The administration in actual operation.</i>&mdash;What most
interests us is the actual working of this machine in Manila, the
provinces and towns, and the works above cited will mostly provide for
us only its skeleton on paper. To make it an effective machine, we must
resort to personal testimony, occasional revelations thrown upon it by
such of our writers as looked beyond mere routine, and perhaps most of
all to the periodical literature of the times.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e2543src" href="#xd27e2543" name="xd27e2543src">48</a> Few of the
resident writers of the old r&eacute;gime thought it was quite
patriotic, or would serve their personal interests, to discuss matters
as frankly, for example, as did Sancianco y Goson.<a class="noteref"

government was actually administered.<a class="noteref" id=

government reports under American rule bring to light here and there
revelations about the former administration, especially in fiscal and
judicial matters. The customs collections benefited the treasury far
less than they should have done; perhaps fully as much as was turned in

inaugurated, dragged along in desultory fashion and the value of

<p><i>Taxation.</i>&mdash;No one of the works on administration just
cited treats this subject in a comprehensive or satisfactory manner.
The only special study of the subject that is known to the writer is
Carl C. Plehn&rsquo;s <i>Taxation in the Philippines (Political Science
Quarterly</i>, xvi, pp. 680&ndash;711, and xvii, pp. 125&ndash;148),
and the author of this excellent survey had to drag his data forth from
the official records and compilations. This survey gives all the most
necessary information as to kinds of taxes, their incidence, and
amounts; but for the most part there lie outside of its scope the
questions one wishes to have answered as to methods of collection and
the working of the fiscal administration in general, the actual
receipts and expenditures for government purposes, and particularly the
special local revenues so far as separate from general <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>revenues. Sancianco y Goson again helps to fill
the gap, as regards the system of taxation prevailing before the
abolition of the tobacco monopoly and the reform of the tribute and the
corvee in 1884.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2604src" href="#xd27e2604"
name="xd27e2604src">53</a> Anyone who has had experience with Spanish
fiscal tables need not be told that they do not always show what they
appear to show. It is thus that the writers who have reproduced in

"noteref" id="xd27e2613src" href="#xd27e2613" name=
"xd27e2613src">54</a> have unwittingly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>misled their readers
as to the real cost of government under Spain. The figures shown in
these budgets were the totals of <i>net</i> collections (and
expenditures), <i>for ordinary purposes</i>, for the <i>central
government</i> of the islands alone. They did not include the purely
local licenses and other taxes, the surcharges on general taxes for
local government (to be expended under supervision of the central
authorities), the percentages that went to collectors, the other fees
forming part or all of the compensation of some judicial and other
officials, special surcharges for port works and other purposes not
covered in the ordinary budget, etc. Naturally, no estimate was
included of the value of the forced-labor levy. The products of
&ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; and &ldquo;pickings,&rdquo; in some cases so
fully established as to be notorious, were of course not included;
nevertheless, they represented part of the cost of government to the
people. Finally, an ecclesiastical establishment, really a part of the
government itself, drew support from the people in many ways beyond
what would have been provided had not the power of government been
behind it, under a system of voluntary contributions, for instance,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=

the friars as landlords.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2667src" href=

<p>The Spanish-Philippine debt of 40,000,000 pesos, incurred in 1897 in
consequence of the insurrection, has not had sufficient notice as being
originally the cause at Paris of the payment of $20,000,000 by the
United States to Spain in connection with the clause of the treaty
providing for the cession of the Philippines. Had the islands remained
under Spanish sovereignty, they would have carried this their first
public debt, expended wholly for war purposes, part of it being loaned
for the payment of military operations in Cuba.<a class="noteref" id=

with that introduced in 1899 in <i>Military Governor on Civil Affairs

be specially mentioned for the criminal law and procedure, 1880 to
1894, and also for an appendix containing circulars as to judicial fees
of various sorts. For brief summaries in English of the old judicial
organizations see Exhibit J of the <i>Report of the Taft Philippine
Commission</i>, 1900, a r&eacute;sum&eacute; by Chief Justice Arellano,

<p><i>Science and material resources.</i>&mdash;So far as the
scientific work of the period has a direct bearing upon our present
purposes, it relates rather to the section on Economic Development. But
the materials are sufficiently listed in the <i>Bibliography</i>, and
the subject is introduced here only to say that this is one of the
lines along which, in recent years, Spanish administration was
beginning to make progress. This was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>true, however,
chiefly of forestry and mineralogy, and was due almost entirely to the
Spanish officials Abella y Casariego, Centeno y Garc&iacute;a, and
Sebastian Vidal y Soler, and to the stimulus of the work of foreign
investigators, especially Germans. The work of the Jesuits in
meteorology should also be specially mentioned. It will be noted that
little headway was made in the matter most vital for the Philippines,
viz., agriculture; nor can we say that even a beginning was made in
industrial chemistry or other researches calculated to foster either
incipient or undeveloped industries, while the public health service
was lamentably defective and scientific research relating thereto
amounted practically to nothing. Reference may be made to the already
large list of publications of the present Philippine government&rsquo;s
Bureau of Science, Board of Health, Agriculture, Forestry, and Mining
bureaus as showing the state of scientific investigation before 1898,
also for bibliographical data.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e2763src"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Religious Question.</i>&mdash;It need scarcely be
repeated that the &ldquo;friar controversy&rdquo; enters not only into
this, but every phase of our discussion, and in one form or another, is
touched upon in almost all our sources of information about the
Philippines. For one thing, however, we are not here concerned with a
historical judgment upon the work of the friars in the Philippines,
though it is proper to note that there has of late been evident a
reaction in their favor from the tendency common in the United States
immediately after 1898 to judge them wholly by recent events, and their
work is now more fairly viewed in its three-century perspective. We
are, moreover, excused from entering upon a comprehensive survey of
literature about the friars and their work in general by the fact that
the subject has been constantly to the fore throughout this series.
What is needed here is only the citation, supplementary to the
<i>Bibliography</i> and to the great accumulation of bibliographical
references in other volumes of this series, of certain titles easily
overlooked (some because of recent publication) and of such special
passages in all these works as elucidate particular matters of
importance.</p>
<p>As with all the political literature of the Philippines,
1860&ndash;1898, the reader is to be warned against the exaggerations
of both sides. Always and everywhere, religious privileges and
prejudices have aroused discussion both violent and intolerant; and in
this case we find, on one side, a defense of religious and
ecclesiastical privileges of a medieval character <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>and
in a tone and temper inherited from those times. Nor, even setting the
purely ecclesiastical and religious questions aside, need we expect to
find in this literature any review or discussion written in a calm and
scientific spirit. Spanish political literature is almost entirely
polemic, and Spanish polemics is <i lang="la">sui generis</i>. So, as
with the friars and their defenders, we find here the principles of
modern political science, which appeal properly to cool reason and the
tolerance of liberalism, put forward by Spaniards and Filipinos in a
language and with a spirit that hark back to times which we have come
to think of as far remote from ours.</p>
<p>The bitterness of tone, the intolerance and contempt of the
Filipino, and the flaunting of &ldquo;race superiority,&rdquo; which
came to characterize the writings of the friars and their defenders in
this period&mdash;and which played no small part in leading the
Filipinos to the brink of separation&mdash;are shown to the full in the
numbers of <i lang="es">La Pol&iacute;tica de Espa&ntilde;a en
Filipinas</i>, 1891&ndash;98. The purpose of this organ was to combat
in Spain the program of those who would further liberalize the
r&eacute;gime of society and government in the Philippines. W. E.
Retana, at first an associate editor with Jos&eacute; Feced, was after
1895 its sole editor. Just what were the relations of the Madrid
establishments of the Philippine religious orders with the business
department of this periodical is not known; but it is admitted that
&ldquo;the friars helped by subscriptions&rdquo; at least, and it has
generally been supposed that their connection with it was really
closer, in short that it was practically an organ of theirs.<a class=

and anti-liberal account and view of events and matters current during
the years of its publication, and also various studies of earlier years
written from the same point of view. The case for the friars,
especially for the period from 1863 on, may also be found quite
typically set forth in a single volume of five hundred pages by a
Philippine Augustinian, Padre Eladio Zamora (<i lang="es">Las
corporaciones religiosas en Filipinas</i>, Valladolid, 1901).<a class=

Taft in 1900 regarding the friars and their part in the old
r&eacute;gime, by the Spanish archbishop and heads of the orders
themselves as well as by Filipinos on the other side will be found in
<i>Senate Document no. 190</i>, 56th Congress, 2nd session.</p>
<p><i>Friars&rsquo; Estates.</i>&mdash;The above document, which is
entitled <i>Lands held for ecclesiastical or religious uses in the
Philippines</i>, also gives information on the friars&rsquo; rural
estates. One will find no comprehensive treatment of this subject
before 1898, though it is usually touched upon, often with great
inaccuracy, in the anti-friar pamphlets. For further data upon the
subject in American official reports, see: <i>Report of War
Department</i>, 1900, i, part 4, pp. 502&ndash;508 (General Otis);
<i>Report of Taft Philippine Commission</i>, 1900, pp. 23&ndash;33;

<p><i>The Filipino clergy and their Cause.</i>&mdash;Contests between
secular and regular ecclesiastics, and over the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>subjection of friar-curates to ordinary
jurisdiction had filled many pages of Philippine history in every
century. But, when revived under somewhat new forms from about 1863 on,
as remarked in the introduction to these notes, they speedily assumed a
new and rather distinct phase. The introduction has noted the
connection of the Jesuits&rsquo; return with the encroachment upon the
Filipino secular priests and with the counter demand for the belated
subjection of the friar-parishes to the ordinary ecclesiastical
legislation and jurisdiction of the Church; under the encouragement of
the 1868 revolution in Spain, these demands grew apace from 1868 to
1872, and became interlaced with strictly political demands, until
finally we may regard the cause of the Filipino clergy as a part of the
campaign for Filipino nationalism. The reaction of 1872 and immediately
subsequent years checked it, and it has found full expression only
since Spanish sovereignty was overthrown; but it is best considered in
its broadest scope, as a part of the Filipino movement toward
nationality, though it may have been but dimly or not at all felt as
such by some of its most active protagonists.</p>
<p>For the documents showing what was the modern phase of the question
regarding parishes in its beginnings, see the pamphlets cited in the
<i>List</i> of the Library of Congress under Agu[a]do (p. 64), and in
Pardo de Tavera&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Biblioteca</i> under the same name
and numbers 681, 873, 1,348 and 1,962.<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>come down to the period of American rule for
full statements of the case of the Filipino clergy against the friars.
A Spanish cleric, formerly an Augustinian friar-curate, who was
excloistered on his own petition some time before the end of Spanish
rule and has since continued to reside in the islands, has been the
chief spokesman for the Filipino clergy. He is Salvador Pons y Torres,
and, apart from frequent contributions on the subject to the press of
Manila since 1898 and various pamphlets, he undertook to review the
entire subject in his <i lang="es">Defensa del clero filipino</i> and
its supplement <i lang="es">El clero secular filipino</i>, both
published at Manila in 1900; while in connection with the visit of
Delegate Chapelle, a campaign was being conducted for fuller
recognition of the Filipino clergy by the Vatican.<a class="noteref"

<p><i>Revolt of 1872.</i>&mdash;That the chief victims of this episode
were prominent Filipino priests connects it rather with
religio-political than with purely political matters. The civilians who
were arrested for too great activity in agitating for political
privileges were deported to Guam, whence their escape to foreign ports
was perhaps winked at, while after a time some of them returned to the
Philippines.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3006src" href="#xd27e3006"
name="xd27e3006src">73</a> But the three most prominent priests who
were tried for complicity in the mutiny at Cavite (Burgos, a
Spanish-Filipino, Zamora, a Chinese-Filipino, and Gomez, a pure-blooded
Filipino) were condemned to death by a very speedily summoned
court-martial and were promptly executed. If we had the record of the
proofs submitted before this court-martial <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>(which acted very summarily and under pressure
of official and other demonstrations of indignation, not to say
vindictiveness), and the statement of its conclusions, we should be in
better position to judge whether or not a great injustice was done. But
neither officially nor semi-officially was the guilt of the condemned
ever shown, and we have either to accept very vehement and intemperate
assertions about it having been proved, or to incline to the belief
that these men were struck down by a power which stretched out its hand
in the dark, and that their death was a punishment for having ventured
under the preceding Liberal administrations to advocate the withdrawal
of the friars as curates of parishes. Certainly this became the belief
of the Filipino people, propagated from year to year by word of mouth

Frenchman Plauchut in the <i lang="fr">Revue des deux mondes</i> for

or near Manila at the time of these occurrences. Finally, Dr. Pardo de
Tavera, a nephew of one of the prominent Philippine Spaniards who were
deported, supports Plauchut&rsquo;s version and impeaches Montero y
Vidal&rsquo;s.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3045src" href="#xd27e3045"

<p><i>Reforms and Demands for more.
&ldquo;Assimilation.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;The reactionists had regained the
saddle in the Philippines even before the Republic in Spain came to an
end; they used the incident of the Cavite <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>mutiny as a
&ldquo;horrible example,&rdquo; and succeeded in repealing or
nullifying all reforms not to their taste even in educational or purely
administrative matters. Till after 1880, the &ldquo;Filipino
cause&rdquo; was in hiding. But meanwhile young Filipinos of wealth
were going abroad for education, and above all a new generation of
Filipinos were coming from the new middle class produced by the better
industrial opportunities consequent upon expanding trade and commerce,
were breathing in popular ideas of hostility to the friars in the more
advanced rural districts, and were exchanging ideas, and imbibing in
the exchange a new sentiment of nationality, when they met, in
constantly increasing numbers, in the colleges and normal school at
Manila, Tag&aacute;logs, Ilokanos, Bisayans and others of the hitherto
separate communities. Regional feeling was still strong, but it was
beginning to break down.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3076src" href=
"#xd27e3076" name="xd27e3076src">76</a> Those who went abroad for
education soon began to propagate the idea, already half expressed at
home, that Philippine education, even with the improvements, was still
archaic and in some ways anti-modern; and every avenue out of this
condition was found to be blocked by the friars. If in reality the men
of Spanish blood (in whole or part) who had agitated for greater
political liberties during 1868&ndash;72, had aimed at separating the
Philippines from Spain&mdash;and all the reasonable probabilities are
opposed to such a belief&mdash;at any rate, the new generation of
Filipinos who took up the cause in the eighties were ardent and, for
some time at least, sincere advocates of Spanish-Philippine union. They
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>carried the matter, indeed, to the extreme, in
the campaign for &ldquo;assimilation,&rdquo; which has already been
characterized as unpractical.</p>
<p>Reforms of a partial nature, any statesman could predict, would
breed the demand for more. So, during the eighties, when most headway
was made in administrative and legal reforms under Liberal
administrations, we find the Filipinos formulating demands for the
first time; and it is significant that they all centered about the
friars. Under the liberal Governor-General Terrero, and with
sympathetic Spaniards in the posts of secretary of the civil
administration and civil governor of Manila, officers of some of the
Tag&aacute;log towns ventured to display a sense of independence of the
traditional friar-dictatorship in local affairs, even (in the case of
Malolos and the Binondo district of Manila) to carry contests with the
friars over the personal tax-lists before higher authority; the
friars&rsquo; tenants around Kalamba, where Jos&eacute; Rizal&rsquo;s
parents lived, challenged the administrator of that Dominican estate,
and aired their protests publicly in 1887;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3086src" href="#xd27e3086" name="xd27e3086src">77</a> and in 1888
a public demonstration against the friars, and especially Archbishop
Payo, took place in Manila, and a petition for the removal of the
friars was addressed to the Queen Regent. In 1887 these civil
authorities of Liberal affiliation had issued official orders regarding
cemeteries and church funerals, contravening, on grounds of public
health, long-standing practices of the friar-curates; and the friars,
even the archbishop, had been almost <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>openly intransigent
about the matter, indicating the belief that they would soon upset this
r&eacute;gime of affairs by the exercise of their power at Madrid. The
demand on the part of some Spanish periodicals of Manila that the
proposed government trade school should not be surrendered to the
Augustinians was another indication of the current of the
times.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3091src" href="#xd27e3091" name=
"xd27e3091src">78</a></p>
<p>In form at least, there was nothing in any of these demonstrations
or representations which would not be perfectly legitimate under any
free government. Yet, even before the expiration of Terrero&rsquo;s
term, he was prevailed upon to send home Centeno y Garc&iacute;a, the
civil governor of Manila, and the processes of law had been set in
action by judicial authority against some of the participants. And,
even before the downfall of the Liberal ministry at Madrid, the mere
display of a disposition on the part of Filipinos to speak for
themselves as a people had started the currents of reaction there.
Weyler was the successor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>of Terrero as Governor-General.
The friars&rsquo; representations at Madrid obtained, while the Liberal
minister Becerra<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3110src" href="#xd27e3110"
name="xd27e3110src">79</a> was still in office, the omission of the
provisions for civil marriage and registration from the Civil Code as
it was extended to the Philippines in 1889. Weyler used force to quell
the subsequent disturbances at Kalamba, and among the score or so of
deportees were some of Rizal&rsquo;s family.<a class="noteref" id=

<p><i>The Propagandists.</i>&mdash;A full history of the Filipino
Propaganda would list a large number of names, both of members of the
Filipino colonies abroad and of secret agitators and wealthy
contributors at home. But the story must be developed from the various
sources to be cited, and we are concerned here with those who figured
most actively by their writings. Of these, Marcelo H. del Pilar and
Jos&eacute; Rizal were altogether the most notable, their prominence
indeed leading to the formation of factions about them and the display
of those personal jealousies which wreck or threaten to wreck every
Filipino movement.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3124src" href=
"#xd27e3124" name="xd27e3124src">81</a> It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>is
significant that the propagandists coming to the front in the eighties
were, one may say, genuine &ldquo;sons of the people&rdquo; though
associated with them were others who were sons of the half-caste
aristocracy. It is significant also, that, though these two leaders Del
Pilar and Rizal, came from Bulakan and Laguna provinces respectively,
the heart of the more advanced communities of Tag&aacute;logs around
Manila, yet the islands as a whole were beginning to be represented in
the propaganda, notably by the Lunas, from Ilokos, and Graciano Lopez
Jaena, a Bisayan. The latter started the first Filipino periodical of
consequence, <i lang="es">La Solidaridad</i>, and published eighteen
numbers of it at Barcelona up to October 31, 1889, when Del Pilar took
charge of it, transferred it to Madrid and edited it there as a
fortnightly till 1895. It was face to face with <i lang="es">La
Pol&iacute;tica de Espa&ntilde;a en Filipinas</i> from 1891, and, as
the latter is the chief source for the pro-friar and anti-liberal side
of the controversy, so <i lang="es">La Solidaridad</i>, which
circulated among the educated Filipinos in many parts of the
archipelago despite the censorship, is the chief source for the
writings of the propagandists.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3141src"
href="#xd27e3141" name="xd27e3141src">82</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>Marcelo H. del Pilar had taken an active part in stimulating
opposition to the friar-curates, particularly in matters of local
government, in his native province (Bulakan) for some years before the
troubles of 1888. When the pendulum swung towards reaction, he left his
family (being then a man of middle-age) and went to Spain to carry on
the fight close by the center of government, support of his campaign
being pledged by a committee who undertook to secure Filipino
subscriptions, certain wealthy Filipinos being identified privately
with the cause. Del Pilar&rsquo;s writings show nothing of the poet or
dreamer, as do Rizal&rsquo;s; he had, in some degree, an
&ldquo;economic mind,&rdquo; though entirely untrained in that line,
and he was at the outset of the active propaganda in Spain (1889) a
maturer man than Rizal. Coming straight from the problems of actual
life among his people, he stated their grievances with more practical
reference to direct and immediate remedies and with special reference
to their economic status; while Rizal, as a student in contact with
modern European life and thought, dreamed of and preached, in more
general terms but on a far wider scope, the social regeneration of his
people and the expansion of their political rights. Del Pilar would
have made a good representative of his people in the Cortes. But Rizal
was a genius, who with the touch of imagination and satire lifted the
cause of the Filipinos to a place in the thought of the world, and at
the same time, as poet and patriot combined, fired the enthusiasm of
his own people and became their idol. And, in the course of events,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>it was Rizal who proved the soberer, the more
mature as time went by. He was opposed to means of violence, even to
the last, and the whole record bears out his protestations on this
score; he still looked to the future as a dreamer-patriot, but he also
looked to the present state of his people and saw that the most vital
problem was the teaching them that they must raise themselves by their
own efforts, must deserve a better destiny. Del Pilar, disappointed by
the failure to achieve greater immediate, practical results by relying
upon the progress of Liberalism in Spain, after seven years of
propaganda along these lines, was starting for Hongkong or Japan, to
conduct there a really revolutionary campaign, when death overtook him
shortly before the Tag&aacute;log revolt in 1896. He had, apparently,
lost faith in the ideals of &ldquo;assimilation,&rdquo; of
Spanish-Filipino unity, which he had set forth in glowing phrases in
1888 and 1889. He had also, apparently, become convinced that the
upper-class Filipinos, especially the most wealthy and prominent, were
too lukewarm or too prone to temporize for safety&rsquo;s sake, that
the time had come to make the cause more distinctly one of the people
as a whole. He is credited with having suggested and outlined the
organization of the Katipunan, and he seems to have concluded that it
was time for the Filipinos to resort to Cuba&rsquo;s example and not to
political petitions only.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3170src" href=

<p>Even in <i lang="la">Noli me tangere</i>, first published under his
own eye at Berlin in 1887, when Rizal, at the age of twenty-six, was
just fairly setting out in life, there are many evidences that the
author, if he meant primarily to set before the world the backwardness
of the existing social and political r&eacute;gime in the Philippines,
its stifling of thought, and its many tyrannies, had also in mind to
set before his people, in some of his instantaneous photographs of
Philippine life, their own defects. In <i lang="es">El
filibusterismo</i> (Ghent, 1891), the more mature reformer preached yet
more plainly the necessity of social and political progress beginning
from below, and not simply inspired from above. That his people took
the lessons meant for themselves (and take them still today) less to
heart than they responded to the satire and invective directed against
the form of rule imposed upon them, was the fault not of Rizal but of
human nature, prone to apply the preacher&rsquo;s words only to the
other fellow.</p>
<p>It is a great misfortune that we have in English no real translation
of <i lang="la">Noli me tangere</i>,<a class="noteref" id=

events of 1880 to 1896, nor even a good biographical sketch of him, has
been published in the English language. Retana&rsquo;s biographical and
bibliographical notes, published in a Madrid monthly, <i lang=

<p><i>Masonry</i>, <i lang="es">Liga Filipina</i>, <i>etc.</i>&mdash;In
almost all the Spanish writings about the Philippine insurrection,
especially those by friars, we find it ascribed primarily to
&ldquo;Franc-Masoner&iacute;a,&rdquo; the terrible bugaboo in naming
which the Spanish friar sums up in one word his notion of all that is
pernicious in modern life since the French Revolution, and the chief
cause of the loss by Spain of her American colonies. So, as to the
Philippines, the argument is, had not Spanish Masons been able secretly
to organize there, and to pervert the minds of certain Filipinos, the
colony would have remained in its loyalty of primitive simplicity and
happiness. The truth is that Masonry played a very secondary part in
the Filipino agitation for reform, furnishing simply a convenient
medium for conducting the propaganda. Up to the last ten years of
Spanish rule, only a few lodges of Spanish Liberals and foreigners,
into which some of the half-castes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182"
href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>and more well-to-do Filipinos
had been admitted, had been organized in the Philippines, and had led a
rather irregular existence. At about the time when <i lang="es">La
Solidaridad</i> was moved to Madrid, a Spanish-Filipino Association was
there formed, in which Spaniards and Filipinos combined to agitate for
reform. This circle was virtually identified in membership with a
certain Spanish Grand Lodge (probably spurious, as regards the
legitimate parent organization of Free Masonry), which delegated agents
to conduct the active organization of new Philippine lodges dependent
upon it. It appears certain that this was done with the idea definitely
in view of being able thus to propagate liberal political ideas and
secretly distribute such literature among the Filipinos, also the more
easily to raise funds for the work. But had not such a favorable means
of conducting the propaganda been presented, it would have been
improvised. One must subject to critical examination the Spanish
writings, and will readily discover their exaggerated deductions from
such facts as came to light.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3330src" href=
"#xd27e3330" name="xd27e3330src">90</a> Interesting reading is afforded
by the confidential Royal Order of July 2, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=

Blanco.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3355src" href="#xd27e3355" name=
"xd27e3355src">91</a> It approves his deportation of the <i lang=
"es">principales</i>, or headmen, of Malolos and Taal (who had defied
the local friar-curates), and orders him to have provincial and other
officials watch and report confidentially on all secret organizations
(forbidden by the Laws of the Indies, as recited in Royal Order of
August 2, 1888) and list all persons of whom &ldquo;there may be
indications enough to believe that they are affiliated,&rdquo; etc.
(opening up thus a splendid opportunity for private denunciations). He
is to use in this secret work only officials who are Peninsulars, never
natives; so also he is to invite co&ouml;peration of &ldquo;the
parish-priests who belong to the religious orders.&rdquo; As to
punishments, it is preferable to deport the &ldquo;suspected,&rdquo;
fixing their residence in the Moro country or Guam, rather than to
exile them, as they would then join the colonies abroad and conduct a
propaganda.</p>
<p>The project of Marcelo del Pilar for an association called <i lang=
"es">Solidaridad Filipina</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3369src"
href="#xd27e3369" name="xd27e3369src">92</a> which came to nothing
practical, and the <i lang="es">Liga Filipina</i>, organized by Rizal
just before his deportation from Manila in July, 1892, though in part
modeled after Masonry, are among the things which show that the
Filipino propagandists did not confine their efforts to Masonic
organization. Our Spanish sources would have it that the <i lang=
"es">Liga Filipina</i> was really separatist in character, and the
prosecution deliberately based upon this charge the demand for
Rizal&rsquo;s conviction in 1896. It remains unproved, and the statutes
of the League as prepared by Rizal<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3381src"
href="#xd27e3381" name="xd27e3381src">93</a> entirely support his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>assertion that the design of the League was to
foster co&ouml;peration among the Filipinos, to &ldquo;raise the arts
and sciences,&rdquo; and develop Filipino commercial and economic
interests generally. The organization was a fraternal society, in
effect, the aim being to bring Filipinos closer together in a
&ldquo;brotherhood,&rdquo; and incidentally to undermine the control of
Chinese and others upon the trade of the country&mdash;in which
respects it would likely have proved mostly utopian, even had not
political conditions and Rizal&rsquo;s deportation brought it virtually
to naught. In the pledges of its &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; to stand by
each other for the &ldquo;remedy of abuses&rdquo; as well as for other
things, the League very plainly looked toward unity of action in
matters social and political, and no doubt the idea of bringing his
people together for such political action as might become possible was
foremost in the mind of Rizal and its other organizers. But this does
not prove the charge that it merely covered up a plan to get arms and
rise in rebellion as soon as possible.</p>
<p><i>The Katipunan.</i>&mdash;We come now to the parting of the ways.
Just as Marcelo del Pilar had concluded that the time was at hand for
more vigorous measures, so on the other hand some of the Filipinos of
education and social position (cautious also, in some cases, because of
their property) had become discouraged and faint-hearted. The
deportation of Rizal had its effect in 1892, and the local government
reforms of 1893&ndash;94 were followed by a reactionary government in
Spain which might nullify even such <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>concessions, in the
face of the constant demand for a check upon the half-liberal
r&eacute;gime of Blanco. Some of the middle-class leaders of Manila,
who had been drawn into the Masonic movement, had decided that the time
had come to organize the masses, at least in the Tag&aacute;log
provinces. Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio, an employe of a foreign business
house in Manila, was the leading spirit; gathering his ideas of modern
reform from reading Spanish treatises on the French Revolution, he had
imbibed also a notion that the methods of the mob in Paris were those
best adapted to secure amelioration for the Filipinos. His ideas were
those of a socialist, and of a socialist of the French Revolution type,
and he thought them applicable to an undeveloped tropical country,
where the pressure of industrial competition is almost unknown, and
where with the slightest reasonable exertion starvation may be
dismissed from thought. There was in this new propaganda an element of
resentment toward the wealthy, upper-class Filipinos, the landed
proprietors in general, as well as toward the friar landlords and the
whole fabric of government and society resting on them. Summing up all
the evidence he has been able to obtain on the Katipunan, the writer
agrees with Felipe G. Calder&oacute;n, a Filipino, in his
opinion<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3401src" href="#xd27e3401" name=
"xd27e3401src">94</a> that its socialistic character negatives the
assertion of the Spanish writers that the upper-class Filipinos were
its real supporters and directors, working in the background; and that,
while this propaganda from below looked to independence and the
substitution of Spanish rule by Filipino rule, yet it was without any
political program, properly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href=
"#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>speaking, and there was merely a
crude idea in the minds of the masses that they were somehow going to
shake off their masters, get rid of the whites, and divide up the big
estates not only of the friars but of Filipino landholders as well.
Calder&oacute;n does not discuss the alleged plan of the Katipunan to
assassinate the whites, especially the friars. It is certain that such
bloodthirsty ideas were in the minds of some of the leaders; but the
more direct documentary evidence that has been produced on this point
is perhaps open to the suspicion that it was manufactured in connection
with the courts-martial which operated with such fury after the
outbreak of revolt in 1896.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3409src" href=
"#xd27e3409" name="xd27e3409src">95</a> After all the furore that had
been made, the actual revelations as to the importance of the
organization, character of its leaders, number of its followers, and
extent of its operations, would have made the whole affair somewhat
ridiculous, had it not been represented that behind this humble
organization of perhaps forty thousand initiates in the Tag&aacute;log
towns there was a great program for setting up an independent
government and that the upper-class Filipinos were simply using this
organization as a stalking-horse. The truth appears to be that, while
these over-important Katipunan leaders thought in terms grandiloquent,
and led their humble <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187"
name="pb187">187</a>]</span>followers in the towns around Manila most
affected by the propaganda to indulge in futile and ridiculous dreams
of a coming millennium (while some of themselves were quarreling over
the obols contributed), the movement was mostly talk even up to the
time when an Augustinian curate in Manila made himself the hero of the
rabid Spanish element in Manila by &ldquo;exposing&rdquo; an
organization about which the governmental authorities had had partial
information for some weeks, or even months. Bonifacio started this
separate organization in 1894, but Calder&oacute;n seems to be correct
in saying that work in the towns outside of Manila was only begun in
the spring of 1896. The humble followers were assured that the Japanese
government would help them oust Spain, and that rifles to arm the whole
population would come from there. But Japan never in the least violated
her obligations to Spain, and, if the leaders even <i>bought</i> any
rifles in Japan, they must have been few indeed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3424src" href="#xd27e3424" name="xd27e3424src">96</a> When
Bonifacio sent an emissary to Dapitan in the spring of 1896, to propose
to Rizal a plan of armed revolt and that he should escape on a steam
vessel sent for the purpose, and join in this campaign, Rizal rejected
the proposition as folly, and displayed his great impatience with
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3436src" href="#xd27e3436" name=
"xd27e3436src">97</a> On every ground, it seems probable that, had not
Friar Gil and the Spanish press of Manila been so insistent on giving
great publicity to some Katipunan engraving-stones, receipts
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>for dues, etc., kept in hiding by the affiliated
employes of a Spanish newspaper, the revolt might never have come about
at all. Certainly, no date was set for it (though various future dates
had been vaguely discussed), till the sudden arrests of August 19 and
20, 1896, sent Bonifacio and his companions fleeing to Bulakan Province
where, practically without arms, they appealed to their fellow-workers
in Bulakan, Manila, and Cavite provinces to rise in revolt on August
30. The friars and the rabid element of Spanish patriots were so
anxious to force the hand of Blanco, and to discredit him, that, it may
be, they forced upon a military commander whose troops were mostly in
Mindanao a revolt that, a few months further on, might either have
dissipated itself or have been avoided by an adequate show of
force.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3447src" href="#xd27e3447" name=
"xd27e3447src">98</a></p>
<p>Because the friars are so much to the fore in all the discussions of
these events, we must not overlook the part played by governmental
abuses, as already described. The Civil Guard, given a more extensive
organization and scope of action during these closing years of Spanish
rule, by its abuses (committed, for the most part, by Filipinos upon
their own fellows) played probably the foremost part in drawing odium
upon the government.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3464src" href=
"#xd27e3464" name="xd27e3464src">99</a> Next to police abuses, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>sometimes allied with them, were the misuses of
the powers of local government (with which alone the great majority of
the people came into direct contact), especially in regard to the levy
of forced labor; and here again, the humble Filipino&rsquo;s complaint
was chiefly against his own fellow-countrymen of power and position.
But, summing up all the administrative abuses and all the evils of the
government system, we are still left a long way from agreement with the

"#xd27e3491" name="xd27e3491src">101</a> We are dependent chiefly on
Spanish sources, written in the passion of the times by men not careful
about sifting the facts. All things considered, the two best sources,
both for what they say and for what may be inferred from them, are the
so-called <i lang="es">Memorias</i> of two Governor-Generals, prepared
in order to defend their administrations before the Spanish Senate and
the public; that of Blanco covering the preparatory stage and early
months of the rebellion, that of Primo de Rivera its closing stages.
Between these two Governor-Generals, the work of Monteverde y Sedano
covers the military operations under Polavieja.</p>
<p>Blanco&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Memoria</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3501src" href="#xd27e3501" name="xd27e3501src">102</a> affords,
unconsciously, the most severe indictment that could be passed on
Spain&rsquo;s fitness to hold the Philippines (or her other colonies)
in 1898. This man was really of liberal temperament; he had formed a
just conception of the real insignificance of the Katipunan movement;
and he strove, when the crisis was prematurely forced on him, to
restrain the vindictiveness of the rabid Spanish element, and really
believed in the efficacy of a &ldquo;policy of attraction.&rdquo; But
instead of setting forth on broader grounds the reasons for his course
of action and discussing with sincerity and frankness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>a
policy for the Philippines, he felt compelled after his return to Spain
to bow before the howls of press and public. He defends himself before
his clerical-conservative critics not by showing the folly of their
illiberal policy for the colony, but endeavors to prove that they were
wrong in accusing him of lack of severity as well as of energy. Thus we
learn (p. 20) that, even under a Blanco, before the outbreak came, one
thousand and forty-two persons had been deported &ldquo;as Masons,
disaffected and suspicious or harmful to their towns.&rdquo; During the
night of August 19&ndash;20, 1896, following the sensation created by
Friar Gil, there were forty-three arrests in Manila, and three hundred
more within the next week. During September, thirty seven men taken in
arms were shot, after summary trials (p. 25.) The number of Filipinos,
mostly men of some position, who had not taken up arms, but were
arrested for alleged complicity in the Katipunan, and involved in the
trials before a special court for conspiracy and sedition, very soon
mounted to five hundred, including those sent in from the provinces.
Some remained <i lang="es">incomunicados</i> for more than forty days.
The men executed from September 4 to December 12, 1896, when Blanco
surrendered command to Polavieja, numbered seventy-four in
all.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3511src" href="#xd27e3511" name=

<p>Evidence as to the &ldquo;reign of terror&rdquo; that was

these writers, and should be used to supplement this history of the
insurrection. Transcriptions of testimony taken by the special court
for sedition and conspiracy appear in Retana&rsquo;s <i lang=

witnesses had their phraseology, and sometimes their statements of
fact, dictated to them will be noted by the careful reader, especially
if he be familiar with Spanish methods of judicial procedure.
References to the common use of torture to make witnesses (in some
cases eager enough to insure their own safety by
&ldquo;delation&rdquo;) sign such testimony, will be found in the

<p><i>The Pact of Biak-na-bat&oacute;.</i>&mdash;Purposely, the word
&ldquo;treaty,&rdquo; so often applied to this transaction, is here
avoided; for, apart from technical objections to a word that applies to
agreements between sovereign powers, this was no treaty in any sense of
the word. There was some mystery surrounding the negotiations by which
the insurgent chiefs surrendered a few hundred nondescript firearms and
retired to Hongkong; untrue or half-true charges were bandied back and
forth, for political effect, in the Cortes and the press of Spain; and,
of the chief actors in the affair, only Primo de Rivera has given his
account&mdash;perhaps not with entire frankness.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3697src" href="#xd27e3697" name="xd27e3697src">109</a> Aguinaldo
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>has confined his statements on the subject to
the most brief assertions of a general nature<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3707src" href="#xd27e3707" name="xd27e3707src">110</a> to the
effect that reforms by the Spanish government were promised. Primo de
Rivera categorically denies this; while Pedro A. Paterno, the
go-between, has made no statement at all during the nine years that
have passed since the conflicting statements have been before the
public, involving directly the question of his own veracity and good
faith. Primo de Rivera is an <i>ex parte</i> witness, to be sure; but
his statements upon the more vital points involved are corroborated by
the very insurgent documents on this subject captured by the American
army in 1899 and now in the War Department at Washington.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3721src" href="#xd27e3721" name=
"xd27e3721src">111</a> Primo de Rivera says that, when Paterno
presented a paper early in the negotiations containing a full program
of reforms,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3734src" href="#xd27e3734" name=
"xd27e3734src">112</a> he rejected the document absolutely,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>saying he could not discuss such matters with
the insurgent chiefs, that the Spanish government would accord such
reforms as it thought wise, and he could only interpose his good
offices to make recommendations in that respect. The copy of this
document now in the War Department at Washington shows the clauses
about reform to have been crossed out. Primo de Rivera says that, from
that time forth, the negotiation was purely on the basis of a payment
to the rebel chiefs to surrender their arms, order the insurgents in
the other provinces to do the same, and emigrate to foreign parts. The
only documents bearing signatures on both sides, either of those
published at Washington or elsewhere, refer exclusively to these
particular points of money, surrender of arms, and program of
emigration, though Paterno inserted in a preliminary of the final
contract on these subjects a clause as to reposing confidence in the
Spanish government to &ldquo;satisfy the desire of the Filipino
people.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3745src" href="#xd27e3745"
name="xd27e3745src">113</a> Primo de Rivera recommended the transaction
to his government for one reason, expressly because it would
&ldquo;discredit [<i lang="es">desprestigiando</i>] the chiefs selling
out and emigrating.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3754src" href=
"#xd27e3754" name="xd27e3754src">114</a></p>
<p>The first proposition of the insurgents was for 3,000,000 pesos;
Primo de Rivera acceded, under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198"
href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>authority from Madrid, to
1,700,000 pesos; and the total sum named in the contract signed on
December 14, 1897, is 800,000 pesos. When Aguinaldo and his
twenty-seven companions reached Hongkong, they received 400,000 pesos
and never any more. Though really looking at it as a bribe, the Spanish
government had consented to the money payment ostensibly on the ground
of indemnity to widows, orphans, and those who had suffered property
losses by the war, and to provide support for the insurgent chiefs
abroad. That it was the idea of at least some of the insurgent leaders
that the money was to be divided between them is shown by a protest
signed by eight of those who remained behind to secure the surrender of
more arms than the paltry number of two hundred and twenty-five turned
over at Biak-na-bat&oacute;, appealing to Primo de Rivera for
&ldquo;their share.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3764src" href=
"#xd27e3764" name="xd27e3764src">115</a> The latter says he turned over
to these men and Paterno the 200,000 pesos of the second payment (the
actual disposition of which is unknown<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3773src" href="#xd27e3773" name="xd27e3773src">116</a>); and that
he turned over the remaining 200,000 pesos to Governor-General
August&iacute;n in April, 1898, when it was evident that peace had not
been assured, after all. As to the remaining 900,000 pesos which Primo
de Rivera had authority to pay, but which did not appear in the final
contract, Primo de Rivera says (pp. 133, 134) that Paterno omitted them
from the document because they were to be used to &ldquo;indemnify
those not in arms,&rdquo; and that he did not &ldquo;think <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>it
prudent to inquire further about them at the time.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3781src" href="#xd27e3781" name=
"xd27e3781src">117</a></p>
<p>Enough has been developed to show the demoralizing character of the
transaction. In justice to Aguinaldo and his closest associates, it is
to be said that they had kept the money practically intact, for use in
a possible future insurrection, until they spent some of it for arms
after Commodore Dewey&rsquo;s victory in Manila Bay.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e3789src" href="#xd27e3789" name="xd27e3789src">118</a> Nor are
we able to say categorically that Aguinaldo and the other leaders in
Biak-na-bat&oacute; were not led to believe that specific reforms had
been promised verbally by Primo de Rivera in the name of his
government; Aguinaldo and Paterno could clear up that matter, but
neither speaks. Just what informal discussion of this subject there was
between Paterno and Primo de Rivera, we do not know; but the
latter&rsquo;s own version will warrant the conclusion that he at least
permitted Paterno to lay before the insurgents the fact that he was
making recommendations on this line, and to hold out the expectation of
results, once he was not confronted with armed rebellion.<a class=

"pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>a scheme of
Philippine reform, covering also the friar question, had been drawn up
and agreed upon, when Premier C&aacute;novas was assassinated and the
Conservatives soon after fell from power; but he does not tell us what
were the reforms as to the friars. Primo de Rivera continued to give
his ideas as to the need for reform in provision of parishes, church
fees, local government, education, civil service, etc., after the
Liberals came into power. Yet, though stating the case against the
friars in strong terms, virtually confirming every charge made against
them, he appears to have advised only a curtailment of their power and
a more rigid discipline, not their elimination as parish-priests, which
was the aim of most of the insurgents.<a class="noteref" id=

<p><i>The Question of Independence.</i>&mdash;We have, on one hand, the
assertions of rabid Spanish writers that separation from Spain was
throughout the real aim of the Filipino leaders, who merely covered it
under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>a plea for reforms (the friars say, under a
false assertion that the Filipinos were opposed to them). We have, in
direct opposition, the assertions of Spanish Liberals and of some
Filipinos that the movement was inspired by genuine loyalty to Spain,
and was only a protest and appeal for reforms even in its last phase as
an outbreak in arms, 1896&ndash;98. This view was accepted by the
Schurman Commission in 1899. Again, during the years from 1898 to date,
when demands for independence were made upon the United States, the
more radical Filipino leaders, first in insurrection, now in political
agitation, have asserted that complete political independence was
definitely the aim in 1896&ndash;97, and was the ideal in mind for some
years before. Thus they would corroborate the assertions of the more
rabid Spaniards who claimed that Rizal and all his co-workers, both in
the aristocratic ranks above and in the Katipunan below, were
hypocritical in their protestations of loyalty to Spain. Where does the
truth lie?</p>
<p>The fact is, one can sustain any view he prefers to take of this
subject, by detached citations from documents of one sort or another.
The real answer is to be found only by a careful survey of all the
evidence as to Filipino activities and aspirations. We note that, when
Rizal discusses the possibility of future independence for his people,
he sets it as a century hence. We need not take him literally, nor, on
the other hand, need we say his title was merely hypocritical, and he
was insidiously inciting his people to think of immediate independence;
we shall be fairer to survey his writings as a whole, probably reaching
the conclusion that the independence of his people was constantly in
his mind, but sober reason warned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203"
href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>him to restrain his and their
youthful impatience on the subject. In discussing Del Pilar and Rizal,
it has already been pointed out how the former changed places with the
younger man and became the more impatient of the two; and the
connection of this growing impatience with the more violent nature of
the Katipunan has been shown. So it is not enough to cite detached
passages from Rizal or Del Pilar, for example, to prove either that
they were just filibusters under cover of protestations or, on the
contrary, that they never dreamed of independence.<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e3860src" href="#xd27e3860" name="xd27e3860src">126</a> The
propagandists felt differently at different times, under the pressure
sometimes of self-interest, influenced sometimes by momentary incidents
or passions. It is plain that, with some of them at least, a new tone
had been adopted toward Spain when, at the beginning of 1896, the
manifesto of the Katipunan organ to the Filipinos bitterly
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of three hundred years of slavery &hellip;, our
people have done nothing but lament and ask a little consideration and
a little clemency; but they have answered our lamentations with exile
and imprisonment. For seven years in succession <i lang="es">La
Solidaridad</i> voluntarily lent itself and exhausted its powers to
obtain, not all that they ought to concede, but only just what of right
is owing to us. And what has been the fruit of our effort unto fatigue
and of our loyal faith? Deception, ridicule, death, and bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, tired of lifting our hands in continual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>lamentation, we are at last ourselves; little by
little our voice has lost its tone of melancholy gained in continual
complaint; now &hellip; we raise our heads, so long accustomed to being
bowed, and imbibe strength from the firm hope we possess by reason of
the grandeur of our aim&#8202;&hellip;. We can tell them bluntly that
the phrase &lsquo;Spain the Mother&rsquo; is nothing but just a bit of
adulation, that it is not to be compared with the piece of cloth or rag
by which it is enchained, which trails on the ground; that there is no
such mother and no such child; that there is only a race that robs, a
people that fattens on what is not its own, and a people that is weary
of going, not merely ungorged, but unfed; that we have to put reliance
in nothing but our own powers and in our defense of our own
selves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rizal put in the mouth of the old Filipino priest in <i lang="es">El
Filibusterismo</i> (1891) the view of the thoughtful Filipino patriot,
considering the social defects of his people: &ldquo;We owe the ill
that afflicts us to ourselves; let us not put the blame on anyone else.
If Spain saw that we were less complaisant in the face of tyranny, and
readier to strive and suffer for our rights, Spain would be the first
to give us liberty&#8202;&hellip;. But so long as the Filipino people
has not sufficient vigor to proclaim, with erect front and bared
breast, its right to the social life and to make that right good by
sacrifice, with its own blood; so long as we see that our countrymen,
though hearing in their private life the voice of shame and the clamors
of conscience, yet in public life hold their peace or join the chorus
about him who commits abuses and ridicules the victim of the abuse; so
long as we see them shut themselves up to their own egotism and praise
with forced smile the most iniquitous <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>acts, while their
eyes are begging a part of the booty of such acts, why should liberty
be given to them? With Spain or without Spain, they would be always the
same, and perhaps, perhaps, they would be worse. Of what use would be
independence if the slaves of today would be the tyrants of tomorrow?
And they would be so without doubt, for he loves tyranny who submits to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless Rizal felt that his people had made progress toward social
independence in the five years that followed, till the Katipunan
outbreak came; but he condemned that beforehand as a foolish venture,
and reprobated it as harmful to Filipino interests before his death.
Though in a sense this was a movement for independence, we have seen
that only vague ideas of a political organization were in the minds of
the leaders, while the deluded masses who followed them with, for the
most part, <i>bolos</i> only, had virtually no idea of such an
organization, except that Filipinos should succeed Spaniards.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e3893src" href="#xd27e3893" name=
"xd27e3893src">127</a> The prematurely commenced revolt, as it gained
at the outset, some defensive advantages over the bad military
organization of Spain, developed ideas and aspirations quite beyond the
early crude dreams of its leaders; they were really surprised at their
own (temporary) success, and emboldened thereby.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3899src" href="#xd27e3899" name="xd27e3899src">128</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>Even after the loss of Cavite, when the
revolutionists were hemmed in and hiding in the Bulakan Mountains, they
put forward, in an &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; at Biak-na-bat&oacute;, a
more comprehensive and ambitious political program (a Filipino
Republic, in short) than had ever before been drawn up by
Filipinos.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3923src" href="#xd27e3923" name=
"xd27e3923src">129</a> We know also that no small part was played by
the &ldquo;reign of terror&rdquo; in turning even the moderate
Filipinos against Spanish rule as an entirety. We should be far from
the truth if we should say that this Tag&aacute;log rebellion, and the
demonstrations of sympathy with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207"
href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>it in other provinces,
brought the Filipino people together in a unanimous sentiment for
independence. That it did greatly stimulate this feeling is certain. He
would be a bold man who would now assert that independence was not the
common aspiration, when outside pressure suddenly pricked the bubble of
Spanish authority in 1898 and released the people for the free
expression of their sentiments. But he is equally bold who asserts that
the Filipino people had been suddenly and miraculously transformed into
a real <i>nation</i> by these events, or that the Aguinaldo government
had the support of or really represented the whole country, above all
of the most sober-thinking Filipinos. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

credit should also be given to the Royal Philippine Company (<i lang=

unsuccessful financially, stimulated considerably the development of
Philippine agriculture between 1790 and 1820, after which year it did

Comyn&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Estado</i> says that in 1810 the number of
Spaniards, born in the Peninsula or elsewhere, and of Spanish <i lang=
"es">mestizos</i>, of both sexes and all ages, classes, and
occupations, did not exceed 3,500 to 4,000. Diaz Arenas (<i lang=
"es">Memor&iacute;as hist&oacute;ricas y estad&iacute;sticas de
Filipinas</i>; Manila, 1850) quotes official figures showing 293
Spaniards settled in the provinces, outside of Manila and Tondo, in
1848; and he records 7,544 as the number of Spanish mestizos in the
islands, including Tondo, as Manila province was then called. Cavada
(<i lang="es">Historia geogr&aacute;fica, geol&oacute;gica y
estad&iacute;stica de Filipinas</i>; Manila, 1876), taking his figures
apparently from the governmental statistics as to houses and their
occupants for 1870, gives for that year 3,823 Spaniards (all but 516 of
them males) from the Peninsula, and 9,710
&ldquo;Filipino-Spaniards,&rdquo; the latter classification apparently
including Spanish mestizos with such pure-blooded Spaniards as had been
born in the Philippines. Among his Peninsular Spaniards would be
included over 1,000 members of religious orders, an approximately equal
number of soldiers, and the civil officials of Spanish blood (except a
relatively small number born in the islands themselves, mostly in the
minor categories of officials). J. F. del Pan (<i lang="es">La
poblacion de Filipinas</i>; Manila, 1883), and F. Ca&ntilde;amaque
(<i lang="es">Las &iacute;slas Filipinas</i>; Madrid, 1880) both report
the parochial statistics of 1876 as showing the total of Spaniards,
apart from members of the religious orders, the civil service, and the
army and navy, to be 13,265; Ca&ntilde;amaque speaks of this latter
class as &ldquo;Spaniards without official character (Peninsulars and
Filipinos),&rdquo; and Del Pan calls them &ldquo;persons not subject to
the capitation-tax on account of being of the Spanish race.&rdquo; At
least some of the Spanish mestizos in the islands would appear to have
been included in this total. A statistical r&eacute;sum&eacute; for
1898 (<i lang="es">La Pol&iacute;tica de Espa&ntilde;a en
Filipinas</i>, 1898, pp. 87&ndash;92) gives the number of Spaniards in
the Philippines at the end of Spanish rule as 34,000 (of whom 5,800 are
credited as officers and employees of governments, 3,800 as the normal
number of Spaniards in army and navy, and 1,700 as of the clerical
estate). These figures, like various other estimates in pamphlets of
recent years, are considerably exaggerated; they are reconcilable only
on the supposition that they include not only Spaniards of Philippine
birth, but also Spanish mestizos. In 1903, only 3,888 Peninsular
Spaniards were found in the archipelago. The census of 1896 would have
shown separately Spaniards and Spanish mestizos; but it was not
completed for all provinces, and has never been published. The
foregoing estimates and figures do, however, show the great relative
increase of Spaniards and Spanish influence in the Philippines in the
latter part of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Apropos of Mr. LeRoy&rsquo;s note the
following is of interest as regards the population of the eighteenth
century. &ldquo;The number of Spaniards who are in the part of Manila
not occupied by the friars is very inconsiderable; in 1767, they did
not exceed eight hundred persons. It can be said that the friars are
masters of the city, for all the houses, except perhaps five or six,
belong to them. This makes a fine revenue for them, since the houses
are very dear&mdash;from two hundred to four hundred piasters (one
thousand to two thousand livres). They are still dearer in the suburb
of Santa Cruz, where they are worth at least five hundred piasters, for
it is there that all the foreign merchants from India or China lodge.
Manila is still peopled by the Tag&aacute;logs, who are the natives at
once of this city and of its bishopric; the Tag&aacute;logs serve the
Spaniards as domestics, or live by some petty trade or
occupation.&rdquo; (Le Gentil, <i lang="fr">Voyage</i>, ii, p.
104.)&mdash;<span class="sc">Eds.</span>&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

&ldquo;The Spanish-Filipino Bank, the oldest bank in the islands, was
founded (1852) by an order of the Spanish government uniting the
<i lang="es">obras p&iacute;as</i> funds of the four orders of friars
in the Philippines.&rdquo; (<i>Census of Philippine Islands</i>, iv, p.

tariff revision of 1891, Spanish goods in Spanish ships were made free
of customs duties in Philippine ports; prior to that time they had, as
a rule, paid one-half the duties assessed on foreign
goods.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e1832src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

for instance, when the war with the United States began, the
governor-general of the Philippines who had recently negotiated a peace
with the insurgent chiefs, had just turned over his place to a new man,
a stranger in the islands, and sailed for home. The new Liberal
administration, which came into power in Spain in October, 1897, had
also sent to the Philippines a new set of provincial governors, to take
the place of men who had served, in many cases, less than two years.
Some of these new governors had not gone to their posts when Commodore
Dewey&rsquo;s squadron arrived, and they were consequently blockaded in
Manila.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd27e1841src">&uarr;</a></p>

Jagor, <i lang="de">Reisen in den Philippinen</i> (Berlin, 1873), p.
287.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Also of interest in this connection are
Jagor&rsquo;s remarks in the following two citations from the same book
(pp. 288 and 289, respectively). &ldquo;Government monopolies
mercilessly administered, grievous disregard of the creoles and the
rich mestizos, and the example of the United States, these were the
principal causes of the loss of the American possessions [of Spain];
and the same causes are menacing the Philippines also. Of the
monopolies sufficient account has been given in the text. Mestizos and
creoles are not, it is true, shut out, as formerly in America, from all
offices; but they feel that they are deeply injured and despoiled by
the crowds of office seekers whom the frequent changes of ministers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123n" href="#pb123n" name=
"pb123n">123</a>]</span>at Madrid bring to Manila. Also the influence
of the American elements is at least discernible on the horizon, and
will come more to the front as the relations of the two countries grow
closer. At present these are still of little importance; in the
meantime commerce follows its old routes, which lead to England and the
Atlantic ports of the Union. Nevertheless, he who attempts to form a
judgment as to the future destiny of the Philippines cannot fix his
gaze only on their relations to Spain; he must also consider the mighty
changes which within a few decades are being effected on that side of
our planet. For the first time in the world&rsquo;s history, the
gigantic nations on both sides of a gigantic ocean are beginning to
come into direct intercourse: Russia, which alone is greater than two
divisions of the world together; China, which within her narrow bounds
contains a third of the human race; America, with cultivable soil
enough to support almost three times the entire population of the
earth. Russia&rsquo;s future r&ocirc;le in the Pacific Ocean at present
baffles all calculations. The intercourse of the two other powers will
probably have all the more important consequences when the adjustment
between the immeasurable necessity for human labor-power on the one
hand, and a correspondingly great surplus of that power on the other,
shall fall on it as a problem.&rdquo; &ldquo;But in proportion as the
commerce of the western coast of America extends the influence of the
American elements over the South Sea, the ensnaring spell which the
great republic exercises over the Spanish colonies will not fail to
assert itself in the Philippines also. The Americans appear to be
called upon to bring the germ planted by the Spaniards to its full
development. As conquerors of the New World, representatives of the
body of free citizens in contradistinction to the nobility, they follow
with the axe and plow of the pioneer where the Spaniards had opened the
way with cross and sword. A considerable part of Spanish America
already belongs to the United States, and has, since that occurred,
attained an importance which could not have been anticipated either
during Spanish rule or during the anarchy which ensued after and from
it. In the long run, the Spanish system cannot prevail over the
American. While the former exhausts the colonies through direct
appropriation of them to the privileged classes, and the metropolis
through the drain of its best forces (with, besides, a feeble
population), America draws to itself the most energetic elements from
all lands; and these on her soil, free from all trammels, and
restlessly pushing forward, are continually extending further her power
and influence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124n" href="#pb124n"
name="pb124n">124</a>]</span>The Philippines will so much the less
escape the influence of the two great neighboring empires, since
neither the islands nor their metropolis are in a condition of stable
equilibrium. It seems desirable for the natives that the opinions here
expressed shall not too soon be realized as facts, for their training
thus far has not sufficiently prepared them for success in the contest
with those restless, active, most inconsiderate peoples; they have
dreamed away their youth.&rdquo; Some writers have carried the
evolution one step farther, as for instance, the following: See Count
Edward Wilczek&rsquo;s interesting study on &ldquo;The historical
importance of the Pacific Ocean,&rdquo; in H. F. Helmolt&rsquo;s
<i>History of the World</i> (N. Y., 1902), i, pp. 566&ndash;599; he
predicts a future contest which &ldquo;will have to decide whether, by
the permanent occupation of the northern Pacific, the white race shall
accomplish its world-embracing destiny, or whether, with the goal
already in sight, and for the first time in its history, it will have
to make way for a stronger&rdquo;&mdash;that is, for the yellow race,
in the form of Japan and China.&mdash;<span class=

and 1900, the American government continued the subsidies to the
Jesuits to sustain the normal school and Manila Ateneo. With the
establishment, however, of an educational system under the Taft
Commission, the subsidy to the Ateneo was withdrawn and a Manila public
high school established. The normal school was established in the old
buildings of the exposition of 1887, and was the first special school
organized under Dr. Atkinson. The vacation normal school is due to Dr.
Barrows, who established it in the spring vacation of 1901, in order
that the teachers from the provinces might be gathered together for
brief instruction in new methods, exchange of ideas, and general
inspiration. The regular normal school has been a very notable feature
since 1901, and in some ways the most striking thing in the new school
system. Its woman&rsquo;s dormitory has been a center of Filipino
gatherings and a constant theme of praise by the Filipino press. (From

In his decree providing regulations for carrying out the law, Blanco
explained that the parish priests were to retain their inspection of
the schools as regards the teaching of <i>religion and morals</i>. The
municipal tribunals were expressly created as schoolboards&mdash;an
institution of which Zamora (<i lang="es">Las corporaciones

remained a dead letter in most villages, except in the provinces most
advanced in the propaganda, where the Filipino local officials asserted
their power of regulation (Bulakan, Batangas, Manila, etc.). (From a

ridiculous, as are this author&rsquo;s writings on an imaginary
primitive religion and civilization of the Filipinos. Don Pedro has a
lively imagination, too lively for politics and history, but capable of
providing good entertainment when he exercises it as a dramatist. One
finds him much more pleasing in this r&ocirc;le than as a Filipino
reform propagandist, though in the latter capacity he seems to have
been taken very seriously by Doctor Schurman and Mr. Foreman, and by
various Spanish officials before them, including, for a time,

nevertheless, that such opinions on the highest officials of the

this money was spent in campaigns against the Moros, and perhaps for
other purposes not covered by the budget of ordinary expenses. See
<i lang="es">La Pol&iacute;tica de Espa&ntilde;a en Filipinas</i>, v,
no. 116, for an account of progress in this work up to 1895. The press
of Manila has published during the past few years various articles on
the funds collected by subscription in Spain and the Philippines for
the relief of the sufferers from the earthquake in Manila in 1863. See
particularly <i lang="es">El Renacimiento</i>, Manila, September 18,
1906, for a report on the subject by Attorney-General Araneta. It would
there appear that nearly $450,000 were collected; by 1870, only some
$30,000 had been distributed to the sufferers themselves; whether they
received further shares at a later date does not appear, but $80,000
were loaned from this fund to the <i lang="es">obras p&iacute;as</i> in
1880, and about $15,000 were used for cholera relief in 1888&ndash;89.
Governor-General Ide instructed the attorney-general to demand the
return of the $80,000 from the <i lang="es">obras p&iacute;as</i>, and
recommended that, when $50,000 of this fund had been recovered,
distribution of it among those who suffered losses in 1863 should

Schurman drew from Spanish official publications the budget of
1894&ndash;95 for his exposition of the former Philippine government
(<i>Report of Philippine Commission</i>, 1900, i, pp. 79&ndash;81), and
this has been considerably quoted, with the assumption that it
represented the full cost of government, in recent comparisons with the
American r&eacute;gime. Sawyer (in an appendix) gives the budget of
1896&ndash;97, with just a note showing that charges for collection and
for local government made the actual collections for the poll-tax
considerably larger than the insular budget showed. Foreman, in his
1899 and 1906 editions, only reproduces from his first edition a
fragmentary statement of the 1888 budget, without showing that this was
only partial and without developing the later changes and increases in
taxes. Retana, in the <i lang="es">Estadismo, ap&eacute;ndice H</i>,
under <i lang="es">Rentas &eacute; impuestos del Estado</i>, gives the
general totals of the budgets of 1890 and 1893&ndash;94 (likewise
<i>net</i> totals for the central government alone). See Sancianco y
Goson for proposed budget for 1881&ndash;82. The insular budget was
published annually at Madrid under the title <i lang="es">Presupuestos
generales de gastos &eacute; ingresos de las islas Filipinas</i>. The
budget was made up at Madrid for each fiscal year, and put into effect
by a royal decree (after its receipt in Manila, some few months after
the beginning of the fiscal year which it was to govern). Some changes
or additions were allowed to be made by the governor-general in
imperative circumstances; otherwise the effort was to regulate
Philippine finances just the same as if the islands were a province of
the centralized government of the Peninsula itself. The folio volume of
<i lang="es">Presupuestos</i> published at Madrid, running to several
hundred pages, are valuable for giving in minute detail the
<i>expected</i> items of expenditures, down to the last petty employee
on salary; but they can give, of course, only the <i lang=
"es">estimate</i> of the revenue expected under each item, and actual
collections sometimes varied considerably from these figures. Above
all, these <i lang="es">Presupuestos</i> bear out the general remark
that the Spanish budget as published tends to conceal rather than to
reveal the actual burden resting on the people. They are <i>not</i>
budgets for the insular government alone, hence the budgets for the
city of Manila and for the local governments (provinces and towns),
published separately in some years at Manila, must be consulted to get
total <i>net</i> collections for all branches of government. In
addition, one must dig out for himself from the laws governing
taxation, etc., and from the archives the data regarding fees for
collection, notarial, legal and other fees accruing to private pockets,
surcharges for special purposes, etc.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

most voluminously on this subject, was never in the Philippines, but
drew largely from these Spanish sources, and he has confused the
subject rather than shed light upon it. The German and French
scientists who visited the islands were, in most instances, not
primarily ethnologists, and have done but fragmentary work in this
field. Needless to say, all these sources must be consulted, especially
for the historical side of the subject; but the science of Philippine

columns could also be used to further personal interests, as already
shown in the case of Weyler. Retana has since 1898 executed a
&ldquo;right-about-face,&rdquo; as has been best shown in his recent
biographical study of Rizal. Herein, in various editorial notes in vol.
v of the <i lang="es">Archivo</i> (1905), and in various letters to the
Filipino press of Manila, he has many times virtually apologized for
his political writings up to 1898, has declared that he was always a
&ldquo;Liberal&rdquo; at heart, and has thus written an impugnation of
his own writings in behalf of friar-rule. In a letter to I. de los
Reyes (reproduced from <i lang="es">El Grito del Pueblo</i> of Manila
in <i lang="es">El Renacimiento</i>, Manila, July 24, 1906), Retana
carries this note to the point of practically abject retraction, saying
he never has been really a Catholic, never confessed since his
marriage, etc., and referring to Rizal (whom he bitterly reviled from
1892 to 1898) as a &ldquo;saint,&rdquo; etc. Regarding Retana and
Blumentritt, see also a letter by J. A. LeRoy in the <i>Springfield

work furnished almost the sole basis for the discussion of the work of
the friars by Stephen Bonsal in the <i>North American Review</i> of
Oct., 1902; but Mr. Bonsal, whose article is thus entirely one-sided,
did not state the source of his information. More than this, Mr. Bonsal
has, in translating, made even stronger some of the extreme claims of
Friar Zamora. The latter (pp. 483&ndash;498) cites praise for the
friars from various governors-general: G&aacute;ndara (1866), De la
Torre (1871), Moriones (1877), Weyler (1891), and Primo de Rivera
(1898). It is to be hoped he has not garbled them all as he did the
statement of Primo de Rivera, omitting its most significant expressions
of opinion and exactly reversing its import. Moreover, Mr. Bonsal, in
translating these passages from Zamora, thought it best to leave out,
for his American readers, the statement by Weyler. Much the same ground
as covered by the claims of Zamora is traversed, with citations, by J.
A. LeRoy in the <i>Political Science Quarterly</i> for December, 1903
(also in the same author&rsquo;s <i>Philippine Life</i>, chaps. v and
vii). See also, <i>in re</i> extreme claims for the friars that they
brought about all the internal development, settlement of towns,
development of agriculture, etc., Sancianco y Goson, <i lang="es">El

political phase of the attack on the friars&rsquo; privileges which
rapidly developed, especially in view of the events of 1868, are
discussed from the friars&rsquo; side in the pamphlet <i lang=
"es">Apuntes interesantes</i> (1870), condemned by Pardo de Tavera (no.
91) and ascribed to Barrantes. Retana (<i lang="es">Estadismo</i>, ii,
p. 135*) praises the work and ascribes it to Friar Casimiro Herrero. A
general argument against the friars in those times is that of Manrique
Alonso Lallave, <i lang="es">Los frailes en Filipinas</i> (Madrid,
1872), parts of which were reproduced in <i lang="es">El progreso</i>,
Manila, August 8&ndash;11, 1901. His figures on friar revenues, etc.,
are grossly exaggerated. He was an excloistered Dominican, later turned
Protestant in Spain, and went to the Philippines as a Protestant
missionary in 1890, being poisoned in Manila, according to V. Diaz
Perez (<i lang="es">Los frailes de Filipinas</i>, Madrid, 1904, p.

claims of the Filipinos on grounds of ecclesiastical rule and practice
(the Council of Trent particularly), but it is to be feared that the
author&rsquo;s judgment on matters of authority purely ecclesiastical
is sometimes warped by political or personal feeling. The same
author&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Mi &uacute;ltimo grito de alarma</i> (Bigan

especially Rizal&rsquo;s introduction to his novel <i lang="es">El

circulated among the people to the effect that the friars brought from
Sambales province a native who looked like Father Gomez and who
impersonated the latter in order to implicate him in the mutiny at the
Cavite arsenal, with similar details, is related in an &ldquo;Appeal
for Intervention&rdquo; presented by certain Filipinos in Hongkong to
the Consul-General of the United States at that place in Jan., 1897.
This document, by the way, has never received notice in the United
States so far as known to the writer, who has a manuscript copy of
it.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Rizal dedicated his novel <i lang="es">El
filibusterismo</i> to the three priests executed in consequence of the
Cavite uprising of 1872. That dedication is as follows: &ldquo;The
Church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt the crime that
has been imputed to you; the Government, by surrounding your trials
with mystery and shadows, causes the belief that there was some error,
committed in fatal moments; and all the Philippines, by worshiping your
memory and calling you martyrs, in no sense recognize your culpability.
In so far, therefore, as your complicity in the Cavite mutiny is not
clearly proved, as you may or may not have been patriots, and as you
may or may not have cherished sentiments for justice and for liberty, I
have the right to dedicate my work to you as victims of the evil which
I undertake to combat. And while we wait expectantly upon Spain some
day to restore your good name and cease to be answerable for your
death, let these pages serve as a tardy wreath of dried leaves over
your unknown tombs, and let it be understood that every one who without
clear proofs attacks your memory stains his hands in your blood!&rdquo;

worth quoting:</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;The aspiration for separation is
contrary, Se&ntilde;ora, to the interests of the Filipinos. The
topographical situation of the country, divided into numerous islands,
and the diversity of its regional dialects demand the fortifying aid of
a bond of union such as the ensign of Spain accords; without such a
bond, it would be daily exposed to a breaking-up process hostile to its
repose, and the very conditions of exuberant fertility that its fields,
mines, and virgin forests afford would offer a powerful incentive to
draw upon it international strife to the injury of its own

the new Conservative ministry) empowering the religious orders to
dispose of their estates without intervention of the Crown, as had been
provided by royal orders of 1834 and 1849. The friars had begun to make

penitentiary. Nevertheless, from our pulpits we recommended and
eulogized what caused us disgust and displeasure, because it was so

Joaquin Pellicena y Lopez, a Spanish journalist of Manila, an admirer
of the Jesuits (in some degree, perhaps, an exponent of Jesuit views on
recent years in the Philippines), in the pamphlet <i lang="es">Los
frailes y los filipinos</i> (Manila, Jan., 1901), defends the work of
the friars as a historical whole, but condemns their unwillingness to
progress with the times. As one proof that the rebellion of 1896 was
against the friars, not against Spain, he says (pp. 27&ndash;28) that
Governor-General Polavieja&rsquo;s demand for 25,000 fresh troops in
April, 1897, was, only a pretext to cover his resignation. Polavieja,
who came out to succeed Blanco and under whom Rizal was almost
immediately executed, had suddenly become convinced, says this
journalist, by reading correspondence of Aguinaldo with the Jesuit
superior, that the real cause of the trouble was the friars. As
virtually emissary and appointee of the friars, the inference is,
Polavieja concluded it would be impossible for him to settle the
difficulties successfully. The letters of Aguinaldo to Pio P&iacute;
are most interesting, at least (See <i lang="es">La Politica de
Espa&ntilde;a en Filipinas</i>, vii, pp. 326&ndash;328).&nbsp;<a class=

same as has frequently been cited as the program of reforms promised by

of the <i lang="es">La Junta Patri&oacute;tica</i>, Hongkong, April,

these reforms, and that he himself would remain in the Philippines

Paterno has apparently given to Foreman a partial version of the
transaction for the latter&rsquo;s 1906 edition. Therein Foreman comes
around to imply that there was, after all, no &ldquo;treaty&rdquo;
about reforms, but he is still very much confused as to the money
payments, etc., and almost every sentence contains an inaccuracy. He
appears to have seen the <i lang="es">Diario de las Sesiones de
Cortes</i>, at least for one or two speeches on this subject in 1898,
when there were heated debates on Philippine matters in the Cortes, but
it is strange he never consulted Primo de Rivera&rsquo;s detailed

change of Spanish administration in October, 1897, bringing the
Liberals again into power, with Moret, who had proposed secularization
of education in 1870, as Colonial Minister, was another reason for
expecting liberal measures in the Philippines as well as in Cuba. It
was this new ministry which urged Primo de Rivera to conclude the
Biak-na-bat&oacute; negotiation speedily. One of the indications that
the Biak-na-bat&oacute; documents in the War Department, above cited,
were &ldquo;doctored&rdquo; in some particulars is the insertion in
Paterno&rsquo;s letter to Aguinaldo of Aug. 9, 1897, of a reference to
Moret being Minister; the change of cabinet in Madrid occurred two

which were rapidly growing intolerable.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now [June, 1898]
for the first time arose the idea of independence [in Aguinaldo&rsquo;s
camp].&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

quite sufficient answer, if there were not plenty of others, to Dr.
Schurman&rsquo;s statements quoted above is afforded by this passage in
a proclamation of Aguinaldo as <i>Magdalo</i> at Old Cavite (Kawit),
Oct. 31, 1896 (Castillo y Jimenez, <i lang="es">El Katipunan</i>, pp.
298&ndash;302): &ldquo;The revolutionary committee addresses to all
Filipino citizens who love their country a general call to arms for the
proclamation of Filipino liberty and independence as [a matter of]
right and justice, and the recognition of the new revolutionary
government established by the blood of its sons.&rdquo; And, on the
same date, in a proclamation outlining a rough revolutionary
organization of Cavite province and each of its towns, he says:
&ldquo;Filipinas witnesses today a fact unprecedented in its history:
the conquest of its liberty and of its independence, the most noble and
lofty of its rights.&rdquo; Yet, in March, 1897, Aguinaldo discussed in
the correspondence with the Jesuit superior, as already mentioned, the
reforms he thought the country asked, and expressly disclaimed for the
revolutionists the aim for independence. So also his proclamations and
interviews on leaving for Hongkong after the pact of
Biak-na-bat&oacute; (see <i lang="es">La Pol&iacute;tica de
Espa&ntilde;a en Filipinas</i>, viii, pp. 46, 47).</p>
<p class="footnote cont">However, in a letter to Fray Tomas Espejo
(undated, but written probably in January, 1898), Aguinaldo says:
&ldquo;A great work is this, which demands great sacrifices, followed
by the shedding of quantities of blood. But what matters that, for it
is very little compared to the sublime and holy end which we hold
before ourselves in attempting to take arms against Espa&ntilde;a. For
this we have resolved to sacrifice our lives until we shall hear issue
from the mouths of our compatriots, the blessed phrase &lsquo;All hail,
Filipinas! forever separated from Espa&ntilde;a and conquered through
the heroism of their inhabitants.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; (<i lang="es">La

<h2 class="main">EVENTS IN FILIPINAS, 1841&ndash;1872</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This period, opening with the coming of Governor
Marcelino de Ora&aacute; Lecumberri, and closing during the
governorship of Rafael de Izquierdo y Gutierrez, is one of the most
important and critical in the history of the Philippines. It witnessed
the insurrection of Tayabas (1841) under the leadership of Apolinario
de la Cruz (<i>q.v.</i>, <i>ante</i>, pp. 92, 93); the use of
steamships against the Moros (1848), whereby the Spaniards gained great
advantage; approval for the Spanish-Filipino bank, August 1, 1851, with
a capital stock of 400,000 pesos, and 2,000 shares of 200 pesos each,
of which 1,000 shares were to be acquired by the obras p&iacute;as and
1,000 were open to the public (the bank beginning operation in 1852);
the reinstatement of the Jesuits (October 19, 1852; although the first
band did not arrive until the middle of 1859), whereby education was
given a slightly freer movement;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3947src"

of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=

decrees, and regulations (<i>q.v.</i>, <span class="sc">VOL.
XLVI</span>); the Spanish revolution of 1867&ndash;68, and the new
constitution; the opening of the Suez Canal (November 17, 1869),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>by which communication with the mother-country
was rendered quicker and easier, and liberalism given more decided
tendencies; and lastly, the Cavite insurrection of 1872, which ended
with the execution of three native secular priests. During this period
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>there were in all fourteen regularly-appointed
governors, and eleven provisional terms, in the latter, Ramon Montero y
Blandino serving three times, and Joaquin del Solar twice&mdash;the
average of each term (regular and provisional) being slightly over one
year. This was comparatively a period of newspaper activity, about
thirty newspapers being founded during these years. The entire period
may be called the period of adolescence.</p>

</div>
<p>Conditions in Spain were to a certain extent reflected in the
islands. Confusion and uncertainty in the Peninsula had their
counterpart in the colony. The administrational experiments of the
Madrid officials extended to the government of the colonies, and there
were many changes which vitally affected the Philippines. Some of the
new laws were good; others show a greater or less ignorance regarding
the islands. Throughout, however, the prevailing tone is one of greater
liberalism.</p>
<p>To be classed under foreign politics of the period were the laws
regulating foreign commerce; the slight contact with the Dutch who
appeared to be making overtures for a settlement in the Southern
Islands; some negotiations with the celebrated Rajah Brooke; and the
campaign of Cochinchina, in which the Spaniards aided the French.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>Local politics show great activity. Provincial limits were changed
and fixed, and new provinces were created. Special subordinate
governments were created for the Visayan Islands and for the Marianas.
Police regulations were made, and bodies of police created. There were
city improvements in Manila. Reforms were instituted in the various
provinces in regard to the alcaldes-mayor. Various departments of the
government were also reorganized. In 1867&ndash;68 new regulations were
adopted for the management of the Audiencia of Manila.</p>
<p>In nothing is the upward trend more strongly marked than in economic
lines. The measures passed were often groping, it is true, but yet on
the whole looked toward the greater light. There was an attempt to
exploit the coal mines of the islands, and mining regulations were
made. Agriculture received attention (see <i>post</i>, appendix on
agriculture). Commerce was given greater concessions, and the customs
duties were revised. Provincial chiefs were forbidden to engage in
trade. Various acts of legislation regarding monetary conditions, the
establishment of a mint, and the coinage of special money for the
Philippines attest the greater commercial activity. There was
considerable legislation in regard to tobacco. The many laws regarding
the Chinese have a purely economic basis. Topographical maps which were
ordered made and the new roads ordered constructed indicate a desire to
know the country and its conditions better. Exhibits of Philippine
products were made at the world&rsquo;s fair in London in 1851 and
1862. Telegraphic regulations were made in 1869.</p>
<p>For religious and educational influences of this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>period see the religious appendix in our
<span class="sc">VOL. XXVIII</span>, and the educational appendices in
<span class="sc">VOLS. XLV</span> and <span class="sc">XLVI</span>. An
important order of January 15, 1849, forbade the religious orders to
alienate their property. A decree of June 20, 1849 gave the Recollects
charge of the island of Negros, and they did considerable work there
and developed the island somewhat, although they but built on previous
efforts, and did not accomplish as much as has been claimed. The
re&euml;stablished Society of Jesus was given control of the mission
work of Mindanao in 1861. The suppression of the house of St. John of
God in Manila and the establishment of the Sisters of Charity were
asked from the pope in 1852, at the time of the re&euml;stablishment of
the Jesuits. The conciliar seminaries were given into charge of the
Fathers of St. Vincent de Paul on their establishment in the islands.
The Franciscans were allowed to maintain a college in Spain for the
training of missionaries for the Philippines.</p>
<p>The history of the development of the people during this period has
been greatly neglected. There was a decided advance educationally and
politically, as well as a growing discontent, that were due to a
complexity of factors, among which were the easier communication with
Spain, the greater number of Spaniards in the islands, and the spread
of books and papers through the capital and provinces. On the side of
the government there were expeditions into the north country against
the Igorots and other tribes. In the south there were almost continual
campaigns against the Moros, over whom some important victories were
obtained. The usual decrees ordering good treatment of the natives were
issued, with as little effect as of old. The liberal policy that the
government <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>was inclined to adopt toward the natives is
evidenced by the efforts made to secure educational laws, and by the
regulations of 1863. By an order of October 31, 1844, a casino was
opened for the natives in Manila. Another order prohibited the smoking
of opium by Chinese and natives. Discontent in the native body is seen
in the revolts of native soldiers and police. It was forbidden to carry
arms without a license. The lottery established in 1850 had a bad
influence. The vaccination board established at Manila and the leper
hospital established in 1850 at Ceb&uacute;, were on the other hand
good measures, but were not welcomed so heartily as the lottery. The
surreptitious introduction and circulation of books and plays caused
the government in 1854 to attempt to regulate the book trade.
Government pawnshops were opened in 1860 in Manila. Pensions were
granted to the parents of those natives who were killed in the service
of the country. The earthquake of 1863 proved especially disastrous,
and the cholera epidemic of the same year, while not so severe as that
of 1820, decimated the people considerably. The Moret decrees (see
<span class="sc">VOL. XLV</span>, pp. 163&ndash;165) were distinctly in
favor of the natives, but were never carried out. The discontent ever
grew more pronounced, and at last broke out actively in the Cavite
rebellion, which was instigated and promoted by the secular clergy and
others. There has been no attempt to do more than point out general
tendencies during this period, and to note some of the most important
matters. For a good working bibliography, which will be found to cover
this period see Mr. LeRoy&rsquo;s article <i>The Philippines,
1860&ndash;1898&mdash;Some comment and bibliographical notes</i>, which
immediately precedes the present document. <span class=

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3947" href="#xd27e3947src" name="xd27e3947">1</a></span> A royal
decree of Jan. 22, 1784, by Carlos III, declared the ex-Jesuits
competent to acquire and hold property; and, in the case of those
secular coadjutors who had married, to bequeath their property to their
heirs. That monarch died in 1788; and was succeeded by his eldest son,
as Carlos IV. In Oct. 1797, the government learned that the Spanish
ex-Jesuits were determined to return to Spain, on account of the
persecutions and even death which menaced them in the Genoese
territories, owing to a change in the government there, and that some
of them had already <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211n" href=
"#pb211n" name="pb211n">211</a>]</span>reached the Spanish ports; it
therefore decided that they should be allowed to remain in the country,
but must live in certain abandoned convents. The Jesuits objected to
this, and finally the government permitted them (1798) to retire freely
to the homes of their families or into any convents they might choose,
save that they were not allowed to reside in Madrid or other royal
seats. &ldquo;Many ex-Jesuits returned to their fatherland, and others
decided to remain in Italia; but this situation did not last long, for
in the year 1801 another decree was issued condemning them anew to
proscription.&rdquo; Orders were given that within one week all Jesuits
should leave their homes and present themselves at Alicante or
Barcelona, where new orders would be given them. Some fathers advanced
in years were allowed to remain in Spain; but all the rest were for the
second time shipped to Italy, where they suffered great hardship. In
1808 the Spanish government felt more leniently toward these
unfortunate exiles, considering, moreover, the difficulty of furnishing
their pensions, and the fact that all those moneys were thus taken out
of Spain to foreign countries, to find their way ultimately into the
hands of her enemies; and a royal decree by Fernando VII, dated Nov.
15, 1808, granted permission to those Jesuits who desired to return to
Spain, with the same pension which they had been receiving. After the
war between Spain and France was ended, urgent requests were made to
Fernando VII by various personages prominent in ecclesiastical,
educational, and municipal affairs that he would re&euml;stablish in
his dominions the Society of Jesus; and permission was given by a royal
decree dated May 9, 1815, for the Jesuits to have houses in the towns
and cities which had asked for them. A year later, after various
preparations for this change had been made by the government, another
decree extended the re&euml;stablishment to all the towns where the
Jesuits had formerly had their institutions. &ldquo;In virtue of this,
all the Spanish Jesuits who were residing in Italy returned to
Espa&ntilde;a, at the expense of the court. All these decisions were
adopted in Espa&ntilde;a in fulfilment of the bull of Pius VII dated
Aug. 7, 1814, <i lang="la">Solicitudo omnium ecclesiarum</i>, by which
the Jesuits were re&euml;stablished in all the Catholic
countries&mdash;that of Clement XIV, which decreed the extinction of
the order, being thereby annulled.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e3955src"
href="#xd27e3955" name="xd27e3955src">2</a> Not five years <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212n" href="#pb212n" name=

the Society of Jesus in Espa&ntilde;a when, the revolution of 1820
having been successful, the Cortes assembled; and the Spanish monarch,
by decree of September 6 in that same year, again suppressed the
[Jesuit] institute, together with the other monastic orders, allowing
the Jesuits, however, liberty to reside in Espa&ntilde;a. Fernando
communicated to his Holiness the above decision, and Pius VII replied
in a letter of September 15, expressing the displeasure with which he
had received the tidings; but in 1823, the constitutional government
having been destroyed, the regency issued a decree on June 11,
re&euml;stablishing the Society and the rest of the regular orders in
the same condition in which they were before March 7, 1820. Fernando
VII died on Sept. 29, 1833, and the civil war began; and on July 17,
1834, occurred the lamentable massacre<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e3960src" href="#xd27e3960" name="xd27e3960src">3</a> of the
Jesuits and other religious. By royal decree of July 4, 1835, the
Society of Jesus was anew declared extinguished; and its property was
ordered to be sold, in order to apply the product thereof to the
extinction of the public debt. In spite of this decision, the Jesuits
remained established in Espa&ntilde;a; and it was necessary, in the
last revolutionary period, to issue the decree of Oct. 12, 1868,
suppressing the Society of Jesus in the Peninsula and the adjacent
islands; and commanding that within the space of three days all their
colleges and institutions should be closed, and possession be taken of
their temporalities in the form provided on this point by the royal
decree of July 4, 1835. To these provisions were added this, that the
individuals of the suppressed Society might not again reunite in a body
or a community, nor wear the garb of the order, nor be in any way
subordinate to the superiors of the order who existed either within or
without Espa&ntilde;a, those who were not ordained <i lang="la">in
sacris</i> remaining subject in all matters to the ordinary civil
jurisdiction. But the realization of this measure was ephemeral; for
when the constitution of June 5, 1869, was published, the right of
every person was declared&mdash;and repeated in the constitution of
June 30, 1876&mdash;to associate with others for all the purposes in
human life which are not opposed to public morals; and, by favor of
this liberty, the individuals of the Society of Jesus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213n" href="#pb213n" name=
"pb213n">213</a>]</span>considered themselves authorized to form an
association and found anew colleges and houses in the Spanish
dominions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">A brief of Pope Leo XIII, dated July 13, 1886,
finally re&euml;stablished the Society of Jesus throughout the world,
and abrogated that of Clement XIV which in 1773 suppressed the order.
The pope took occasion to express this permission in the warmest and
most forcible terms; and &ldquo;the rehabilitation of the Society of
Jesus could not have been more complete or more satisfactory.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is pleasant to observe that, after three centuries of strife,
the principle of authority has triumphed.&rdquo; (Danvila, <i lang=

constitution was partly printed at London, at the London Printing
Press, No. 25 Khulug St., in both Spanish and Tag&aacute;log. Those
parts printed (the ends, duties of the members, and the general rules)
contain some changes from Rizal&rsquo;s MS. Preceding the constitution
proper is the membership pledge to the Liga. It is as follows:
&ldquo;Number &hellip; To &hellip; of &hellip; I &hellip; of &hellip;
years of age, of &hellip; state, profession &hellip;, as a chosen son
of Filipinas, declare under formal oath that I know and entirely
understand the ends aimed at by the Liga Filipina, whose text appears
on the back of the present. Therefore, I submit myself, and of my own
accord petition the chief &hellip; of this province, to admit me as a
member and coworker in the same, and for that purpose I am ready to
unconditionally lend the necessary proofs that may be demanded of me,
in testimony of my sincere adhesion!&rdquo; The ends of this printed
text are the same as those of the MS. The motto is the same, and there
is also a place for a countersign. The duties of the members are
somewhat changed, the changes being as follows: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225n" href="#pb225n" name=
"pb225n">225</a>]</span>&ldquo;1. He shall pay two pesos for one single
time, as an entrance fee, and fifty centimos as monthly fee, from the
month of his entrance. 2. With the consciousness of what he owes to his
fatherland, for whose prosperity and through the welfare that he ought
to covet for his parents, children, brothers and sisters, and the
beloved beings who surround him, he must sacrifice every personal
interest, and blindly and promptly obey every command, every order,
verbal or written, which emanates from his Council or from the
Provincial Chief. 3. He shall immediately inform, and without the loss
of a moment, the authorities of his Council of whatever he sees, notes,
or hears that constitutes danger for the tranquillity of the Liga
Filipina or anything touching it. He shall earnestly endeavor to be
sincere, truthful, and minute in all that he shall have to communicate.
4. He shall observe the utmost secrecy in regard to the deeds, acts,
and decisions of his Council and of the Liga Filipina in general from
the profane, even though they be his parents, brothers and sisters,
children, etc., at the cost of his own life, for this is the means by
which the member will obtain what he most desires in life.&rdquo;
Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are the same. The general rules of the
printed version are as follows: &ldquo;In order that the candidate may
be admitted as a member to the Liga Filipina, he must possess morality,
good habits, not have been proceeded against justifiably as a robber,
shall not be a gambler, drunkard, or libertine. The candidate must
solicit and petition his entrance from a member; and the latter shall
communicate it to his Fiscal, for the investigations that must be made
in regard to his conduct.&rdquo; On Dec. 30, 1903, a monument was
erected to Rizal, to his companions, and to other founders of the Liga
Filipina by the village of Tondo, on a site given by Timoteo Paez, one
of the members of the Liga. On the monument is the following
inscription: &ldquo;Remember [this word in English, the rest in
Spanish]. Facing this site and at house No. 176 Ilaya St., Dr. Rizal

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">His Excellency, the Minister of the colonies:</p>
<p>We, the superiors of the corporations of the Augustinians,
Franciscans, Recollects, Dominicans, and Jesuits, established in
Filipinas, in fulfilment of the statement of the telegram presented to
his Excellency, the governor-general and viceroyal patron,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4279src" href="#xd27e4279" name="xd27e4279src">1</a>
on the first instant, to be transmitted officially to your Excellency,
and which has been done by the said superior authority, as he has
condescended to inform us, have the honor of presenting this exposition
to his Majesty, King Don Alfonso XIII (whom may God preserve), and in
his royal name, to her Majesty, the queen regent, Do&ntilde;a
Mar&iacute;a Cristina, to the president and members [<i lang=
"es">vocales</i>] of the Council of Ministers of the Crown [<i lang=
"es">Ministros de la Corona</i>],<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4288src"
href="#xd27e4288" name="xd27e4288src">2</a> and most especially to your
Excellency, as minister of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href=
"#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>the colonies. We send it directly
to your Excellency, in accordance with law and custom, so that, in due
time, you may condescend to lay it before the lofty personages above
mentioned, and even, if you deem it advisable, before the entire
nation, duly assembled in the Cortes of the kingdom.</p>
<p>In writing this exposition, to us, the religious of the corporations
existing in the country from ancient times, united in one soul and one
heart, as faithful brethren, is reserved the honor in the very
beginning of fulfilling respectfully the most acceptable duty of
reiterating our traditional adhesion to the king, to his government,
and to all the authorities of the fatherland, to whom we have always
considered it an honor to keep ourselves subject and obedient, by the
law of conscience, which is the strongest human bond, endeavoring
continually and in all earthly things, from our respective sphere of
action, to co&ouml;perate with every class of endeavor for the
maintenance of public order in Filipinas, for its legitimate and holy
progress, for the development of its intellectual and even material
interests; and, in a very special manner, for the propagation and
conservation of the divine teachings of Catholicism, for the
encouragement of good morals, and for the security of the moral
prestige, the only force which has been until now the great bond of
union between these beautiful lands and their dear mother the
mother-country [<i lang="es">metr&oacute;poli</i>].</p>
<p><i>Motive for this exposition.</i> Truly, your Excellency, if
extremely troublesome circumstances, by which Spanish authority in the
archipelago is threatened, and the bitter campaign (or better,
conspiracy) of defamation and anti-monastic schemes, incited
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>against us, especially since the outbreak of the
insurrection, did not compel us to talk, very willingly would we leave
it to politicians to occupy themselves with the problems that concern
this country, and we would maintain the silence that has fittingly been
our norm of procedure for many years, not speaking except when
questioned officially, being jealous, by that manner of retirement, of
avoiding the criticism which has so often been heaped upon us with
audacious flippancy or malice, that we meddle with the temporal
government of these islands.</p>
<p>But now the hour is come, when, as loyal patriots and constant
supporters of Spanish authority in Filipinas, we must break that
silence, in order that one may never with reason repeat of us, either
as religious or as subjects of Espa&ntilde;a, that terrible accusation
of the prophet, <i lang="la">canes muti non valentes
latrare</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4315src" href="#xd27e4315"
name="xd27e4315src">3</a> The hour is come, also, when we must emerge
in defense of our honor, atrociously blemished in many ways, of our
prestige that has been trampled upon, of our holy and patriotic
ministry, which has, finally, been subjected to the most terrible
calumnies and the most unqualified accusations. Though private persons
may at any time make a noble renunciation of their good name that has
been defamed, offering to God the sacrifice of what civilized man
esteems highest, never is that allowed in any form, according to the
teachings of the holy doctors of the Church, to public persons, to
prelates, to superiors, to corporations, who must defend and preserve
their prestige, their credit, and their reputation, in order to
worthily fulfil their respective functions. A religious corporation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>discredited and publicly reviled, is in its
class like a nation whose flag is insulted or whose laws are disavowed.
It should die struggling for its honor, rather than allow its good name
to be trodden under foot, and its rights to become unrecognized and
unrevered.</p>
<p><i>Abandonment of the religious corporations and their patience and
prudence under these circumstances.</i> Truly, one cannot qualify us as
hasty and imprudent, in that we now address ourselves to the exalted
authorities of the fatherland. We have borne patiently the continual
insults and vilifications for more than eighteen months of masons and
filibusters, open or hidden, in newspapers, clubs, and public
assemblies, who have attributed to us the blame for the insurrection,
and heaped dishonor on our persons and ministries by the most
unjustifiable attacks, cast in their majority in the mold of demagogism
and free thought. With Christian meekness have we endured the return to
the Peninsula of a multitude of persons who have resided a greater or
less period in the islands, who have shown so little honor to our habit
and profession; but if, instead of being religious, we had been
seculars, and if, instead of being a question of ecclesiastical
corporations, it had been one of civil or military corporations, they
would have refrained from speaking ill of us&mdash;and we can be quite
sure of that, and there are eloquent daily proofs of this
assertion&mdash;for the effective means that such corporations
generally practice would have tied their tongues, and would have made
them recognize their flippancy and their injustice by imposing a
vigorous corrective to their extensions. We religious have no sword; we
cannot pronounce judgment; we do not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>glitter with gilt
braid; we do not belong to a corporation, whose individual members take
part in the government of the fatherland, or in exalted considerations
of the same; we are neither military men nor functionaries of the
judicial or administrative profession; we do not have weight in any
political party; we do not intervene in elections; we do not form (for
conscience forbids us) great federations that become feared; we do not
incite the public, except to obedience and submission to all
constituted authority; we are unable in determined cases to distribute
appointments, or offer promotions or remunerations; we are not
accompanied by a fattened retinue of friends or flatterers, who defend
us for their own personal advantage, and who are the blind paladins of
the general, of the politician, of the exalted dignitary, of the
opulent banker; neither have we any influence over the press; we do not
possess a nucleus of attached partisans to shout for us and overexcite
so-called public opinion: in one word, we are without all the methods
that are used in modern public life to gain respect and fear, to
influence the nation, and cause all the shots of slander or ignorance
to strike ineffectually against us.</p>
<p>The religious of Filipinas, far remote from Europa, alone in their
ministries, scattered even throughout the farthest recesses of the
archipelago, without other associates and other witnesses of their
labors than their dear and simple parishioners, have no defense other
than their reason and right, which, although established on justice and
law, and secured by the protection of the divine Providence&mdash;which
mercifully has not failed us hitherto and which we hope will not fail
us in the future&mdash;do not have, nevertheless, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>in
their favor (nor ever, although we might have done so, would we avail
ourselves of them) those most powerful modern auxiliaries which are
attaining so much vogue and so great success in societies in which the
great Christian sentiments having grown cold, reason is not heard
easily unless supplied with the force of cannon or with the armor-plate
of the high bench, of vast political parties, or of fearful popular
movements.</p>
<p>Alone with our reason and our right, although with our conscience
satisfied at always having fulfilled, yea <i>always</i>, our duties, of
having been as patriotic as the greatest, or more so, and of having
fulfilled the obligations of our sacred ministry, we have endured
silently and in all patience, in accordance with the advice of the
apostle, the insults and vilifications, even of persons to whom we have
offered in Christian sincerity our affection and civilities, even by
persons who call themselves very Catholic, but who, perchance, infected
with the contagion of the practical Jansenism of certain present-day
reformers, forget the remark of that great Christian emperor, who said
that if he should see a priest who had fallen into any frailty, he
would cover him with his cloak, rather than publish his weakness.</p>
<p>Alone, with our reason and our right, and confident that reason
would at last clear the pathway, and that light would at last illumine
the dense obscurity created by hatred of sect, by the separatist
spirit, and by flippancy, envy, and the false zeal of certain persons,
we have endured the insinuations, made in the Cortes [<i lang=
"es">parlamento</i>]<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4345src" href=
"#xd27e4345" name="xd27e4345src">4</a> of last year which showed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>scant respect to the orders; the assertions
made, not only in private, but also in centers of great publicity, and
by persons of considerable popularity in military circles [<i lang=
"es">politica militante</i>], that the religious prestige of Filipinas
was so broken that it was necessary to substitute it with armed force;
the publishing of the recourse of an eminent politician, sacrificed by
anarchy, to the orders for information and advice in Philippine
matters, as a dishonorable censure; the grave accusations directed
against us, as well as against a most worthy prelate, in a memorial
presented to the senate, although veiled under certain appearances of
impartiality and gentle correction; the different-toned clamoring from
day to day, with more or less crudity, in order that the historic
peninsular period of 1834&ndash;40 might be reproduced in the islands,
and in order that measures might be adopted against us, so radical that
they are not taken (and the discussion of them is shameful) either
against the centers of public immorality, or against societies and
attempts that have no other end than to discatholicize the nation and
to sow in it the germs of thorough social upheaval.</p>
<p><i>Why the religious have been silent until now.</i> We believed and
thought that our prudence and long silence, adorned with the qualities
of circumspection and magnanimity which religious institutions should
always possess, ought to be sufficient for discreet and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>fair-minded people, so that they would
immediately impugn those accusations and form a judgment by which those
repeated attacks would not make a dent in our credit and prestige. We
supposed that that campaign of diatribes and reproaches would vanish at
last as a summer cloud formed by the effluvia cast off from the forges
of masonry and filibusterism.</p>
<p>But instead of being dissipated the storm appears to be increasing
daily. The treaty of Biac-na-bat&oacute;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4373src" href="#xd27e4373" name="xd27e4373src">5</a> has again
placed in the mouth of many the crafty assertion, made now by the rebel
leaders that the institutes of the regulars have been the only cause of
the insurrection. The secret society<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4385src" href="#xd27e4385" name="xd27e4385src">6</a> of the
Katipunan, which is extending itself throughout the islands like a
terrible plague, has established by order of its Gran Oriente,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4394src" href="#xd27e4394" name="xd27e4394src">7</a>
the extinction of the religious as one of the first articles of their
program of race hatred. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href=
"#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>In the Peninsula and here, the
masons, and all those who, in one way or another, second them, have
rejuvenated [<i lang="es">recrudecido</i>] their war against us.
Manifestos have been published in Madrid, in which misusing the names
of Filipinas, measures highly disrespectful and vexatious to the clergy
are demanded. Even in the ministry of the colonies, although
officiously, persons have managed to introduce themselves, who, pursued
by the tribunals of justice as unfaithful do not hide their
animadversion to the religious corporations. Now, if we were to
continue silent in view of all these circumstances, our silence would
be taken with reason as cowardice, or as an argument of guilt; our
patience would be qualified as weakness; and even firm and sensible
Catholics who recognize the injustice of the attacks directed upon us,
could with reason infer that we were stained, or that we had come to
such a prostrate condition that one could with impunity insult and mock
us, as if in downright truth we were old and decayed entities whose
decadence is the last symptom of death.</p>
<p><i lang="la">Prius mori, quam f&oelig;dari</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4417src" href="#xd27e4417" name="xd27e4417src">8</a> said the

exist, they will glory, as they ought, in repeating with St. Paul:

"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>endeavored to honor our ministry, and we shall
always continue to honor it, now and in the future, by the grace of
God, which we trust will not fail us. Consequently, we do not vacillate
in addressing ourselves today to the exalted authorities of the nation,
taking shelter in our confidence, that, though we are poor and
helpless, and have no other protection than our spotless history, our
immaculate honor, and our secure rights, we are talking to those in
whom intelligence and good sense are brothers to nobility of thought,
who are always ready to listen, especially to the poor and weak, and in
whom their respect and love to Catholic institutions and to the so
eminently glorious and meritorious title &ldquo;Regular Clergy of
Filipinas,&rdquo; shelter them from the suggestions of sects and the
prejudice of anticlerical and separatist parties.</p>
<p><i>They are persecuted because of their religious significance.</i>
What reason have the religious corporations of Filipinas given that
they should be persecuted with so great passion? Ah! your Excellency,
that reason is no other than because they are very Catholic, because
they are very Spanish, because they are effective supporters of the
good and sane doctrine, and because they have never shown weakness
toward the enemies of God and of the fatherland.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4449src" href="#xd27e4449" name="xd27e4449src">11</a> If we
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>religious had not defended here with inviolable
firmness the secular work which our fathers bequeathed us: if we had
shrunk our shoulders in fear before the work of the lodges and before
the propagation of politico-religious errors that have come to us from
Europa; if we had given the most insignificant sign, not only if not of
sympathy, yet even the least sign of mute passivity, to the advocates
of the false modern liberties condemned by the Church; if the flame of
patriotism had become lessened to us; and innovators had not met in
each religious in Filipinas an unchangeable and terrible adversary to
their plans, open or hidden: never, your Excellency, would we religious
corporations have been the object of the cruel persecution now
practiced on us; but on the contrary, we regulars would have been
exalted to the clouds, and so much the more as our enemies are not
unaware that, granting the influence that we enjoy in the archipelago,
our support, even if passive and one of mere silence, would
indisputably have given them the victory.</p>
<p>But they know that our banner is none other than the <i>Syllabus</i>
of the great pontiff, Pius IX,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4459src"
href="#xd27e4459" name="xd27e4459src">12</a> which has been so often
confirmed by Leo XIII, in which all rebellion against legitimate
authorities is so vigorously <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href=
"#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>condemned. They know that, as
lovers of the only true liberty&mdash;Christian liberty&mdash;we would
rather die than consent, in whatever pertains to us, to the least lack
of the purity of the infallible Catholic teachings, of the holiness of
Christian customs, and of the most complete loyalty due the Spanish
nation. Consequently, they hate us; consequently, veiled under divers
names and with divers pretexts, they are making so cruel war upon us,
that one would believe that the masons and filibusters have no other
enemies in Filipinas than the religious corporations. In such wise does
that honor us that we can very well say with the prince of the
apostles: &ldquo;<i>If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you
shall be blessed: for that which is of the honor, glory, and power of
God, and that which is his spirit resteth upon you</i> (<a class=
"biblink xd27e48" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1pt%204:14&amp;version=NRSV">1
Peter iv, 14).&rdquo;</a><a class="noteref" id="xd27e4483src" href=
"#xd27e4483" name="xd27e4483src">13</a></p>
<p><i>And for their patriotic significance.</i> Apart from their
essentially religious character, the regulars of the archipelago have
another significance that makes them odious to the separatists. They
are the only permanent and deeply-rooted Spanish institution in the
islands, with a suitable and rigorous organization, perfectly adapted
to these regions. While the other Peninsulars live here in the
fulfilment of their duty more or less time, as is convenient to their
private interests, and with no other bond that follows them to
Filipinas than their own convenience, being ignorant of the language of
the country and having no other relations with the natives than those
of a superficial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239"
name="pb239">239</a>]</span>intercourse, we religious come here to
sacrifice our whole life. We form as it were a net of soldiers of
religion and of the fatherland in the archipelago, scattered even to
the remotest villages of the islands. Here we have our history, our
glories, the ancestral house, so to speak, of our family. Bidding an
eternal farewell to our native soil, we condemn ourselves voluntarily,
by virtue of our vows, to live forever consecrated to the moral,
religious, and political education of these natives, for whose defense
we have in all ages waged campaigns, which, without the pious boastings
[<i lang="es">crudezas</i>] and exaggerations of Las Casas,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4495src" href="#xd27e4495" name=
"xd27e4495src">14</a> have constantly reproduced in Filipinas the
figure of the immortal defender of the American natives.</p>
<p><i>Craftiness of the insurgent leaders of filibusterism.</i> In this
point it must be confessed that the insurgent leaders of filibusterism
are logical. &ldquo;Do the regulars,&rdquo; they have asked themselves,
&ldquo;who are the Spaniards most deeply-rooted and most influential in
the country, and the most beloved and respected by the people, agree
to, or will they ever agree to our projects? Then let us petition their
expulsion, and their disappearance in one way or another. If we do not
succeed in it, let us destroy them. Since there are many peninsulars,
who, influenced by modern errors or carried away by ignorance or evil
passion, lend ear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240"
name="pb240">240</a>]</span>to those who inveigh against the religious,
let us inveigh loudly. Let us form a powerful cry against them. Let us
conspire in lodges and political clubs. Let us petition at any risk
measures looking to the lowering and destruction of the regular clergy.
Those peninsulars will listen to us without us having any fear that
they will hold us as filibusters. It will be said of us that we are
liberals, that we are reformers, that we are democrats, that we are
even masons and free-thinkers: but that does not matter. Many
peninsulars are the same. They also inveigh against the religious. They
also petition freedom of thought, freedom of the press, freedom of
association, secularization of education, ecclesiastical
disamortization, suppression of the privileges of the clergy. They also
inveigh against the terrible theocracy, and do not cease to defame the
religious and to impute to them all sorts of crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That, your Excellency, is the watchword that has been given to all
the filibusters, and to all who will procure the emancipation of the
country in one way or another, for their separatist ends, and
especially since the treaty of Biac-na-bat&oacute;. &ldquo;There is
nothing against Espa&ntilde;a, nothing against the king, nothing
against the army, nothing against the Spanish administration: say if
you have seized arms that it has been exclusively because of the abuses
of the clergy, that you were not attempting separation from the
mother-country; that you wished only modern liberties and the
disappearance of the orders. And even though all the documents,
judicial and extrajudicial, in which appear the plans of the
conspirators, and all the acts of the canton of Cavite, during its
ephemeral emancipation, demonstrates the contrary, let us exert
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>ourselves to say that that was not the intention
of the rebels, that that was an affair of some enthusiasts or madmen,
but that the great mass of the insurgents seized arms only through
coveting those liberties. The multitude of lay Spaniards of every class
and profession sacrificed; the countless natives killed or harassed in
innumerable ways, because of their unswerving loyalty to the
fatherland; the cries of &lsquo;Death to the Castilas!&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Long live the Tag&aacute;logs!&rsquo; the stamps of a
Tag&aacute;log republic, a Filipino republic,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4511src" href="#xd27e4511" name="xd27e4511src">15</a> an army of
freedom; the speeches and circulars of the assembly or supreme council;
the fiery Katipunan constitution written in characters of a mysterious
key, and that written at Biac-na-bat&oacute;; and in their style, an
infinite number of deeds and documents, many of them very recent, which
even to satiety evidently demonstrate the anti-Spanish and separatist
character of the insurrection: all that we shall now conceal by crying
&lsquo;Down with the friars!&rsquo; &lsquo;Long live democratic
liberties!&rsquo; &lsquo;Long live Espa&ntilde;a!&rsquo; and with those
cries are we certain of being heard, and in that way shall we be able
to more easily attain the final goal of our desires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is the logic and the tactics of the filibusters, and it must be
confessed that in it they show themselves to possess practical talent,
and to be thoroughly acquainted with the society that surrounds them.
Had they said that the insurrection had been provoked by the excesses
of the government employes, of the military, of the governors, of the
directors of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>the treasury; had they placed in relief the
multitude of abuses that have been committed against the native in one
form or another (although never by the nation, or by the majority of
its sons); had they attributed the armed insurrection to that: they
would now be opposed by all the peninsular element, and their voice
would have had not the slightest echo, as it would have been stifled by
the more powerful voice of others who would have cried out in defense
of the Spanish name, and who would have locked on them the door to all
the means of propaganda and agitation which they are now exploiting.
But when they declaimed against the clergy, when they demanded the
liberties that the clergy cannot in conscience approve, they had at
least assured their campaign, and in part, perhaps, the success of the
same.</p>
<p><i>Their real purposes.</i> Does not this show, your Excellency,
that, in talking of the supposed or enormously exaggerated abuses of
the clergy, they are not moved by love of justice and morality, and
much less by love for Espa&ntilde;a? What then, do they not recognize
that for one religious who has committed abuses, it is to be surmised,
from their employment, that there have been many more laymen in
proportion (and let it be clear that we accuse no one, and least of all
the worthy official corporations) who have converted their office,
totally or partially, into a means for illegal advancement? Have the
insurgents not cried out at other times, and during the preparatory
period of the insurrection, against the meritorious civil guard,
against judges and alcaldes, against the army, against the peninsular
resident in the island, against the administration in general, and even
against the superior authorities of the archipelago? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>Is
not this proved by the books of the unfortunate Rizal, by the <i lang=
"es">Solidaridad</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4533src" href=
"#xd27e4533" name="xd27e4533src">16</a> and other documents and
pamphlets of the laborers, although one must not forget that their
favorite watchword was always to cruelly attack the religious?
Undoubtedly so, but it was not now advisable for them to declare it.
Now was come the opportunity to show themselves very Spanish, very
loyal to the king (they who were affiliating themselves to the extent
of their ability with the most radical parties), very fond of the army,
and to attack only the religious!</p>
<p><i>Accusations against the orders.</i> They work deceitfully, we
shall say with the Psalmist (<a class="biblink xd27e48" title=

<p>Yea, your Excellency, unjust witnesses, for where <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>are
those abuses, those excesses, those vices, those outrages, of which
their mouths are so full, and which furnish them matter for their
speeches of a demagogical club of the rabble? What do the religious
corporations maintain, when viewed with a deep synthetical standard,
which is not in accordance with the canons of the Church and the rules
of their institute; which is not fitting to the holy ministry that they
profess; which is not greatly beneficial to the supreme interests of
the fatherland? We turn our eyes in all directions, and however
quick-sighted may be our eyes, unless one views the orders through the
pharisaical or separatist prism, they discover nothing that does not
merit the heartiest applause. &ldquo;<i lang="la">Laudet te

abdicate nor allow to be vilified. &ldquo;By your good works stop the

<p><i>How they have fulfilled their duties.</i> Our good works are in
the gaze of all men, and our good works, thanks to God, are the
brightest gem of the corporations. Not only do we preach the gospel
here; not only do we carry the Christian and civilized life to the
barbarous and fetish-encumbered inhabitants of these islands; not only
did we obtain the incorporation of the archipelago into the Spanish
crown, working in harmony with the other official entities, and
preserved it, as is well known, in a peaceful and happy condition for
the space of three centuries; but also, in all time, even now when we
are wronged so deeply by some ingrate Filipinos, whom we pity, have we
been the constant defenders of the Indians, enduring for that reason
innumerable loathings, and all kinds of persecution on the part of many
peninsulars, who did not understand the devotion and patriotism of our
conduct. In all time have we been zealous for the purity of the faith
and for the conservation of good morals; and illegal exactions,
bribery, extortions, outrages, ease, immoral gambling, and a licentious
or little restrained life, have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246"
href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>always had in us a severe
judge and the most inexorable censor.</p>
<p>Can it be said of the religious institutes, whether collectively or
in the vast majority of their individual members, that they have
prevaricated; that they have ever abandoned the duties entrusted to
them in the administration of the sacraments, in the celebration of
divine worship, in Christian preaching and catechising, in the
vigilance of good manners, in the tutelage of moral interests, in
protection and relief to the needy and weak, in advice and consolation
to all about us, in the maintenance of obedience to the mother-country,
in the extension of education, in the campaign against every kind of
superstition and erroneous practice, in repression of concubinage, and
of other public irregularities and scandals? Does not the tenet enter
the head of the most exalted sectarian, if he has any lucid moment,
that we religious have fulfilled with assiduous self-abnegation the
obligations of our ministry?</p>
<p>We have become wearied with reading, your Excellency, whatever has
been written and published against us for years, and we know also how
much is said now in assemblies and gatherings. With our hand upon our
heart, with our foreheads raised aloft, as one who walks in the light
and fears not to have his deeds examined and discussed in the light, we
challenge and defy our detractors and calumniators, and those who
flippantly, or by any other unjust and inaccurate motive, talk and
murmur, to show us with exact data and with perfectly authentic
information, not only the accuracy of all their accusations, but the
mere probability of whatever they allege against our honor and
well-established credit, touching the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>fulfilment of our
duties, both religious and patriotic.</p>
<p><i>Their procedure in respect to parochial obventions, to education,
and intercourse with intelligent persons.</i> It is said that we commit
abuse in the exaction of parochial fees. Let the laws of the Church be
consulted, let the doctrines of the moralists and the principles of
positive natural and divine law be cited; and then submitted to that
only sure rule as a criterion, let them tell us whether we abuse the
public in that matter, and whether our procedure, within just bounds,
is not that employed by the most disinterested priests.</p>
<p>It is said that we are hostile to education and the advancement of
knowledge. But if by education and knowledge, doctrines not condemned
by the Church, our Mother, are not meant, let them tell us whether the
islands have any education that has not been established, protected,
sustained, and encouraged by the clergy, in all branches of
instruction, both primary, and secondary and superior.</p>
<p>It is said that we despise the intelligent men of the country, and
that we make them the object of every kind of persecution. That
assertion is so rare and stupendous that we wonder whether our enemies
will write in imaginary spaces. A multitude of youths are graduated
annually with the degree of bachelor or after the conclusion of some
higher course, from the Ateneo Municipal, from the colleges of Manila
and the provinces, and from the university. We are honored by the
friendship of the vast majority of them, and take no little
satisfaction in seeing them prosper and in knowing that they respect
the Christian and solid education that they have received. It is known
that very few of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248"
name="pb248">248</a>]</span>great number of students that attend our
lecture halls, and of the not few graduates that are scattered
throughout the islands, have taken part in the rebellion; and that the
vast majority of them have kept loyal to Espa&ntilde;a, in fulfilment
of the oath that they took on receiving the investiture of their
professions. But what happens in the old world with the apprentices of
free thought happens here: all those <i>modestly</i> call themselves
intelligent who think that they exhibit signs of knowledge and talent
by showing contempt for priests and religious; while it is a fact that
a goodly proportion of those who express themselves in that manner have
been unable to complete their courses with us, and are the refuse of
our lecture halls.</p>
<p><i>Regarding the sanctity of their private life.</i> An outcry is
being made against the vices and immorality of the regulars in terms
that seem to be inspired in Protestant and anticlerical centers of low
quality. But in that, as in other things, saving what can never be
avoided even in the communities most sanely organized, by the severest
legislation and the most exquisite care, all who view us near at hand
are not ignorant that nothing can be thrown into our face.</p>
<p>The words of Father St. Augustine, when defending his institute
against accusations similar to those directed against the orders of
Filipinas, are very opportune and efficacious in this matter.
&ldquo;Tell me, brethren, is my congregation, peradventure, better than
Noah&rsquo;s ark, in which, of the three sons Noah had, one was evil?
Is it, peradventure, better than the family of the patriarch Jacob, in
which, of his twelve sons, only Joseph is praised? Is it, peradventure,
better than the house of the patriarch Isaac, in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>which, of the two sons born to him, one was
chosen of God, and the other damned? Is it, peradventure, better than
the household of Jesus Christ, our Savior, in which, of His twelve
apostles, one was a traitor, and sold him? Is it, peradventure, better
than that company of the seven deacons filled with the Holy spirit,
chosen by the apostles to take charge of the poor and widowed, among
whom one, by name Nicholas, became a heresiarch? Is it, peradventure,
better than heaven itself, whence fell so many angels? Can it be better
than the earthly paradise, where the two first parents of all the human
race, created in original justice and grace, fell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah! the religious corporations of Filipinas, caring for the sanctity
and salvation of all its sons, on seeing one of their individual
members fail in his duties, after correcting him, and after taking, in
accordance with law and religious prudence, measures efficacious to
repair, if he did it, the scandal, and even, if necessary, to destroy
and fling aside the rotten branch, cry out in pity with the apostle
like a true mother: &ldquo;<i lang="la">Quis infirmatur et ego non
infirmor? Quis scandalizatur et ego non uror?</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;Who
becomes sick spiritually and I do not suffer with him? Who suffers
scandal and I am not burned?&rdquo; That is what all should say who
learn of the backslidings of their neighbor; that is the dictate of
charity and of justice; that is demanded by respect and consideration
to the ministers of the church. And so long as our systematic accusers
do not prove that the orders <i>consent and do not check</i> the sins,
in great part humanly inevitable&mdash;considering the conditions under
which those dedicated to the ministry live&mdash;of the very few
religious who have the misfortune and weakness to fall, they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>have no right to dishonor us and to cry out
against what we are the first to lament and to try to correct.</p>
<p>Will they prove it sometime? We are quite assured of the opposite;
and that though they have at hand, as many methods of inquisition and
proof as the judge most interested in any cause can desire. Our
convents, our ministries, our persons, are in sight of all. Our parish
priests and missionaries are alone and surrounded by a multitude of
natives. Whatever we say, do, or neglect to do, is seen and spied by
all the people. Our habitations are of crystal for all classes of
people. Our publicity as Europeans and our condition as priests place
us in such relief in the missions and parishes, that it would be stupid
simplicity to try to hide our doings and actions. Consequently,
everything is favorable to our adversaries in the trial to which we
provoke them, and to which each regular voluntarily submits himself,
from the moment that, faithful to his vocation and obedient to his
superiors, he sacrifices himself to live among these natives, his very
beloved sheep of the flock of Christ. Our honor, our reputation rests
in their hands. It would be easy for our adversaries to confound the
religious institutes if truth presided over their accusations. But
since truth is that which does not glitter in their words, the saying
of Holy Writ becomes verified in their conduct: &ldquo;They spake
against me with a lying tongue, and with the speech of hate did they
attack me;&rdquo; and in regard to us the saying of St. Peter:
&ldquo;You shall keep an upright conscience with modesty and fear, so
that as many as calumniate your upright procedure in Christ, shall be
confounded.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4657src" href=
"#xd27e4657" name="xd27e4657src">23</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Other equally unjust charges.</i> We shall not compare our
conduct with that of the respectable and very estimable native priests
of the secular clergy, whom the majority of the separatist Filipinos
flatter, undoubtedly because it is not to the purpose of their plans to
combat them. We shall not rebut the shamelessness of supposing that
part of our property has a criminal origin, and that we are certain
despots in our rural estates who suck the blood of our tenants by
various methods, an infamy so often refuted with authentic data of
overwhelming proof. We shall not speak of the vast imposture of
imputing to us all the executions by shooting, imprisonments, tortures,
trials, and confiscation of property of those implicated in the last
insurrection. We scorn the absurd fable that we are absolute masters,
not only of consciences, but of all the archipelago, at the same time
that they, obviously contradicting themselves, as error is wont to do,
declare that our prestige and influence in the islands is lost. We
neglect to attribute to ourselves whatever hate and censure, according
to them, have been made in the country by the military [<i lang=
"es">institutos armados</i>], the governors, the judges, and all the
public organisms, in deportations and other kinds of punishment; as if
we religious managed to our liking the machine of the government and
administration of this territory, and as if, from the governor-general
down to the last agent of the police, all were but the blind executors
of our will. We lay aside those and other things&mdash;poorly executed
arguments&mdash;which certain misguided sons of this country are still
employing, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>and which are unfortunately repeated by certain
peninsulars, in order to manifest their hatred or prejudice against the
clergy; and pass on to speak of the insurrection and of the imperious
necessity of remedying the extremely embarrassing situation of the
religious corporations in the archipelago.</p>
<p><i>Fundamental causes of the insurrection, and who are to blame for
it.</i> The government is able only too well to recognize the causes
that have produced the insurrection, and we shall not be the ones who
try to give it lessons in that regard. The government is aware that
until several years ago, every separatist idea, every rebel tendency in
the country, which was enjoying the most enviable peace and felt
respect to authority with the same unreflecting, although patent and
holy, force, with which domestic authority in all parts is obeyed and
respected, was exotic and an anachronism. Then was submission to
Espa&ntilde;a and subordination to all authority an element truly
<i>social</i>, rendered incarnate by the religious in the mass of the
Filipino population, which neither dreamed, yea, your Excellency,
<i>neither dreamed</i> of ideas of political redemption, nor imagined
that, in order to keep themselves loyal to the mother-country, one
single bayonet was necessary in the country. The public force of the
<i lang="es">cuadrilleros</i> and of the <i lang="es">guardia
civil</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e4696src" href="#xd27e4696" name=
"xd27e4696src">24</a> (the latter of very recent creation) was
necessarily created to check and restrain thieves and <i lang=
"es">tulisanes</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4718src" href=
"#xd27e4718" name="xd27e4718src">25</a> while every one thought that
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>wretched army then in the archipelago had no
other object than to combat Mindanaos and Joloans, and to be ready for
any conflict with the neighboring powers. Espa&ntilde;a was able to be
sure of its dominion here, and to live so carelessly, with respect to
political movements as in the most retired village of the Peninsula.
All authority was obeyed, was respected, by conscience, by education,
by tradition, by social habit, passively and by custom, if one wishes,
but with so great strength and firmness, with so indisputable and
universal submission, that more indeed than individual virtue it was
the virtue of the mass of the whole population, it was the spontaneous
homage to God, which, represented in the powers of the fatherland, all
felt and practiced, not conceiving even the possibility of rebellions
and insurrections. Thus had they been taught by the religious, who
always unite the names of God and His Church with the names of their
king and of Espa&ntilde;a. Consequently, by bonds of conscience, did
all the archipelago love and obey him, and no one thought then of
political liberties, nor in lifting yokes that existed for no one.</p>
<p>Are there then no abuses? No, your Excellency it could have very
well happened that there were abuses on a greater scale than in the
epoch immediately preceding the present events. But since these people
were educated in the doctrine that it is never legal to disobey
authority, under pretext of abuses, even if some are true; since these
people had not yet been imbued with the new modern teachings, condemned
a hundred times by the Church; since no one had spoken here of popular
rights, many of them as false as senseless; since the propaganda
against priests and religious had not yet reached Filipinas:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>it resulted that, considering those abuses, as
one of so many plagues of humanity (from which regulated societies are
not free, according to the principles of the newest erroneous law, but
rather they are, on the contrary, suffered with greater intensity and
with greater loss to the fundamental interests of the social order)
these inhabitants tolerated them patiently, and had recourse for their
remedy to the just methods taught in such cases by Catholic ethics,
with the greatest advantage to individuals and to nations.</p>
<p>Consequently, as many as have contributed, in one way or another, to
introduce those revolutionary doctrines, and those germs of social and
political disturbance into the archipelago, whether peninsulars or
islanders, of whatever class or rank, are the true authors, conscious
or unconscious, of the great weakening of the traditional obedience to
the mother-country, of which the whole archipelago was in peaceful
possession until thirty years ago, that was disturbed by no one or by
no influence. The introducers of those doctrines and tendencies are
beyond all doubt the culprits of the insurrection, for they are the
ones who have done their utmost to prepare for it and with success to
unroll it, even supposing that they have not directly and deliberately
procured it.</p>
<p>Who sows the wind will reap the whirlwind; who introduces principles
must accept the consequences; who generates hate must not wonder that
war results; who teaches the pathway of evil cannot declare himself
free from responsibility for the disorders originated by his
teaching.</p>
<p><i>Partial causes: masonry.</i> Will it be necessary to explain this
simple consideration? We do not think so. But should we desire to
unfold it, it would be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href=
"#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>easy for us to add that the
anti-religious propaganda; the ideas of erroneous liberty and forbidden
independence, incited and aroused in certain Filipinos by European
politicians and writers; the antipathy and opposition, clearly shown by
certain Spaniards, even by those ruling and by government <span class=
"corr" id="xd27e4737" title="Source: employes">employees</span>,
against the religious corporations; the establishment of masonry and of
other secret societies, the former&rsquo;s legitimate offspring; the
most favorable reception that the revolutionary Filipinos found for
their plans in many centers and papers of Madrid and other places; the
lack of religion in many peninsulars; the ease with which the ancient
laws of Filipinas have been changed; the mobility of public
functionaries which, giving opportunity for many irregularities, has
contributed greatly to the continual lessening of the credit of the
Spanish name; and in part, the backwardness, which has been observed
sometimes in the sons of the country with regard to public
appointments: [all these] are partial aspects, various phases and
confluent factors (of which we do not attempt to enumerate all) of the
fundamental and synthetical cause that we have expressed.</p>
<p>No one is unaware that the chief of all those partial phases and
factors of the social disorganization of the archipelago has been
masonry. The <i lang="es">Asociaci&oacute;n Hispano-Filipina</i> of
Madrid was masonic. Those who encouraged the Filipinos in their
campaign against the clergy and against the peninsulars here resident,
were masons in almost their totality. Those who authorized the
installation of lodges in the archipelago were masons. Those who
founded the <i lang="tl">Katipunan</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4748src" href="#xd27e4748" name="xd27e4748src">26</a> a society
so mortally masonic, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href=
"#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>even in its terrible suggestive
<i>pact of blood</i> it has done naught but imitate the masonic
<i lang="es">carbonarios</i>, were masons.</p>
<p><i>Practical consequences of that.</i> The traditional submission to
the fatherland, diffused and deeply settled in the archipelago by the
religious corporations, having disappeared in part and having been
greatly weakened in part; the voice of the parish priest, thanks to the
above-mentioned propaganda, having been disregarded by many natives,
especially in Manila and conterminous provinces, who were taught in
that way to give themselves airs as intelligent and independent men;
the prestige of the Spanish name having been greatly tempered, and the
ancient respect with which every peninsular was formerly regarded in
the islands having been almost annihilated in many towns: is it strange
that race instincts should have asserted themselves strongly, and,
considering that they have a distinct language, and distinct lands and
climate, that they should have discussed and have attempted to raise a
wall of separation between Spaniards and Malays? Is it not logical
that, after having been made to believe that the religious is not the
father and shepherd of their souls and their friend and enthusiastic
defender, but a vile exploiter, and that the peninsular here is no more
than a trader constituted with greater or less authority and rank, that
they should madly and illegally have imagined that they could easily
separate from Espa&ntilde;a and aspire to self-government?</p>
<p><i>Gloomy situation of the archipelago and omens of its future.</i>
We shall not insist, your Excellency, on this order of consideration,
for it rends our soul, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>cleaves our heart in twain, to
consider how easily so many rivers of blood, so great and extravagant
expenses, and so extraordinary conflicts, might have been spared, which
in a not long lapse of time, may, perhaps, result in the disappearance
of the immortal flag of Castilla; how easily the military situation,
originated by the insurrection, a situation that was threatening to
make of Filipinas another Cuba, might have been avoided; and with how
little trouble the archipelago might have been continuing at present in
the same tranquillity and peacefully progressive situation as it had
years ago: if having the power, as was a fact, but that was not
attempted or thought of, the door had been shut on the disturbers; if
masonry had never been allowed in the country; and if every tendency
contrary to the moral prestige, the most powerful social bond,
immensely superior to all armies and all political institutions which
united these countries with their beloved and respected mother-country,
had been effectively restrained in their beginnings.</p>
<p>Has the present most gloomy situation any remedy?</p>
<p>It is somewhat difficult, and even dangerous, to answer the
question, for if the Katipunan was six months ago relegated to the
hills of Laguna and Bulacan among the rebel leaders who were fugitive
there, or was dragging out a shameful existence in certain villages
that were in communication with the insurgents, today the plague has
spread. For the ones pardoned at Biac-na-bat&oacute;, breaking the
promise given to the gallant and energetic marquis de Estella,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4779src" href="#xd27e4779" name=
"xd27e4779src">27</a> obedient to the watchword received, have spread
through the central provinces; and by using threats <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>and
terrible punishments, which have no precedents in the pages of history,
nor even of the novel, have succeeded in attracting to their ranks a
great number of Indians, even in villages which gave eloquent proof of
loyalty to the holy cause of the Spanish fatherland before the
submission of Biac-na-bat&oacute;. They have also succeeded in
establishing themselves in C&aacute;piz and in other points of the
Visayas: and indeed the movement of Zambales, of Pangasinan, of Ilocos,
of Ceb&uacute;, and of the Katipunans, are at present open in
Manila.</p>
<p>The thought of what may happen to this beautiful country at any
moment terrifies us, for we do not know to what point sectarian
fanaticism may go, exploiting the suggestibility of this race and their
weak brain by the deeds that they are heralding, brought to a head by
them, in regard to the army, whose increase in the proportion that
would be necessary to establish a complete military situation, they
know to be impossible; by the published exemption from the <i lang=
"es">c&eacute;dula</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e4794src" href=
"#xd27e4794" name="xd27e4794src">28</a> and other tributes; by the
supposed immunity of amulets, called <i lang="tl">anting-anting</i>; by
the illusion that none but Indians will hold office, and that the
alcaldes and generals will be from their ranks; by the remembrance that
money and confidence were given to the rebels of Cavit&eacute;,
Bulacan, and other points; by the news that their partisans were
sending them from Madrid and Hong-kong; by the example of goodly
numbers of peninsulars, who are not on their guard against showing
their hostility to the religious, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259"
href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>in order by that manner to
procure the latter&rsquo;s disregard by their parishioners, who even
dare to lay hands on them; and by innumerable other methods, too many,
in short, to enumerate, but terribly destructive, and of maddening and
vigorous influence in these Malayan villages.</p>
<p>The thought of what consist the <i>secrets</i> of the revolution,
which the learned gentleman, appointed as arbitrator<a class="noteref"
id="xd27e4807src" href="#xd27e4807" name="xd27e4807src">29</a> by the
so-called government of the insurgents to arrange with the superior
authority of the islands as to the conditions of submission and the
surrender of arms, swore to keep secret, as appears from the
justificative document of his authorization, is also terrifying. We are
ignorant of what those <i>secrets</i> may be, which apparently are not
the politico-ecclesiastical reforms which are now demanded in Madrid,
since those matters are mentioned openly in the abovesaid document
signed by Aguinaldo in the name of the rebel assembly; and the most
courageous heart is terrified at the fancy that there might be an
organization more powerful, more far-reaching, more general and active
of revolution, somewhat like the Katipunan, which we now see to be
rapidly spreading, and which at a moment&rsquo;s notice, would effect a
general rising, whose most saddening results one can easily foresee,
and avoid with the greatest difficulty, unless every labor association
be effectually prosecuted and extirpated in time.</p>
<p><i>Remedy for that situation.</i> Laying aside for the meanwhile
those dangers, which are daily obscuring the Filipino horizon more
deeply, and supposing, as we desire, that peace may be obtained
throughout the islands, the situation of the archipelago has a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>remedy, and one, as is clear, that consists in
removing all the causes that have produced so deep a confusion and in
prudently and with justice adopting the measures that, assuring peace,
will protect and encourage the legitimate interests of these
inhabitants. The great mass of the country is not corrupted. It suffers
from an access of hallucination and fanaticism produced by sectarian
preachings and practices, but its heart and head are not perverted. If
it be attended with care, it will return to its former pacific habits
and submission. The wealthy and intelligent classes, still healthy,
protest against all those movements, and since they are loyal and
friendly to us, desire the normal mean to be reestablished as soon as
possible, and will contribute, together with the institutions of the
mother-country, to the most glorious undertaking of restoring order and
the pacific and progressive trend of the archipelago.</p>
<p>It pertains to the government to direct and manage those forces in
order to obtain so satisfactory an end, by reestablishing the
mainsprings of government, now so nearly disappeared or very much
weakened; by giving prestige to all the conservative elements; and with
an administration, grave, intelligent, active, stable, moral,
acquainted with, and fond of the country, and one dissociated with
every political doctrine, to continue and perfect the just and
benevolent, and Catholic and Spanish regimen: whereby the
mother-country would gain the sympathies of these inhabitants and
establish its dominion securely.</p>
<p>This is strange material for the peculiar objects and character of
this exposition, which has no other purpose than to defend the honor of
the religious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>institutes and demonstrate the necessity of
supporting and invigorating their ministry, if they are to continue
their noble and patriotic mission in the archipelago. We do not intend
to mix in politics, however much we may have as much or more right than
any society or individual to speak of these things. But indeed we must
be the defenders of the rights of the Church, and of the regular
clergy. We are indeed under obligations to watch over Spanish
interests, which are not at variance with, but perfectly amalgamated
with religious interests.</p>
<p><i>What the orders need and claim.</i> As religious then, and as
Spaniards, we address the government, and without circumlocutions or
subterfuge (for these are not the times for paraphrases and
<span class="corr" id="xd27e4829" title=
"Source: euphuisms">euphemisms</span> which cloak the truth), we
believe that we can tell the government that if the interests of
Spanish domination in the archipelago have incurred and are incurring
so serious danger of shipwreck, it is because they have rather been,
and are, profoundly combative of the interests of religion; and that if
the revolutionists have succeeded in making themselves heard by a
multitude of natives, it is because they have been taught, before and
during the ingrate rebellion, to despise and even to persecute the
religious who taught them a doctrine of peace and obedience. He who
does not see this, suffers great blindness, or it is an obvious sign
that he is infected with the terrible evil that has brought so dire
consequences to Filipinas. He who closes his ears to the lessons of
Providence&mdash;sorrowful, but indeed healthful lessons&mdash;and
believes that it is possible to restore order here and establish a
prosperous and tranquil progress without strengthening religious
influences, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>is not far from the separatist camp, or shows
that he is unable to learn from great social catastrophes.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient for that purpose to recognize the need of
morality and of religion. One must recognize them in all their
integrity and purity, such as our holy Mother, the Church, makes them
known. It is not sufficient to talk to the people of the great
doctrines of the Crucified, and instruct them not to attempt to attack
the legitimate interests of Catholicism&mdash;vagaries that so very
often cover mischievous and pharisaical intentions, in order afterward,
under pretext of abuses, to tell them by word and deed, not to listen
to the priests who preach those doctrines to them and inculcate in them
respect for those interests. If one would attempt to effectively
establish the peace of the archipelago upon a firm base, he must
support <i lang="la">in toto</i> and <i lang="la">in solido</i> the
mission of the religious corporations, so that they may be fruitful in
the proportion that these inhabitants demand, who are still
affectionate to the faith and to civilization, and so that the natives
may be strengthened in the solid conviction that they are obliged to
obey and respect Espa&ntilde;a, their true fatherland in the social and
civic order, by bonds of conscience and not by human considerations
which are always unstable and shifting.</p>
<p>Consequently, we regulars who have more than sufficient reasons to
recognize to their full extent the evils that affect the archipelago,
so beloved by us, and who have been for some time experiencing the fact
that, far from religious action being strengthened, it is restricted
and opposed in various ways, do not waver in telling the government
with blunt frankness that, if it do not consent to give that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>support, daily more necessary, to the Church,
the social disturbance of the country will continue to increase daily,
and that by not applying any remedy to that evil, the stay here of the
religious is becoming morally impossible.</p>
<p>Of what use is it for us to force ourselves to fulfil our
religio-patriotic duties, if others take it upon themselves to destroy
that labor on the instant; if they, by methods that flatter evil
passions so greatly, gain the favor of the same people whom we have
taught to be docile and submissive, by saying to them continually that
they should pay no attention to us? Would it suffice, peradventure, to
preach respect to property, if, at the same time, there were no laws
that protected it and public force that effectively restrained those
covetous of another? Would any professor be assured of the effects of
his teaching, whose pupils were to be told by respectable persons or
through vexatious methods, as they left the lecture room, to forget or
despise the lessons of their masters? Then in like case do we find
ourselves in Filipinas.</p>
<p>We do not want, your Excellency, temporal honors or dignities, which
we have renounced by choosing for our profession a life hidden in Jesus
Christ. We do not belong to those who, in whatever they do, think
immediately, even when deserving them, of recompenses and decorations.
We do not desire, as our enemies believe (who judge us, perhaps, from
themselves), to preponderate in the civil government and administration
of the villages, nor even at least to continue our slight official
intervention assigned to us in certain secular matters by law and
tradition. If one desires to strip the parish priest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>or
the missionary of all administrative, gubernatorial, and economic
functions, in which, without us ever claiming it, yea, <i>ever</i>, the
secular authority has come to solicit our modest cooperation, let it be
done at a seasonable time. Those who adopt such an inclination will see
what is most advisable for the exalted interests of the fatherland; but
from them and not from us, who have ever (even enduring because of that
intervention, annoyances, censures, and persecutions, and considering
it a true burden) been docile auxiliaries of the civil authority, will
be demanded the responsibility of the consequences that may be
occasioned by so far-reaching a measure.</p>
<p>We have come to the islands to preach and to preserve the Christian
faith, and to instruct these natives with the celestial food of the
sacraments and the maxims of the gospel; to prove that the principal
intent of Espa&ntilde;a, on incorporating this territory with its
crown, was to christianize and civilize the natives. We have not come
to become alcaldes, governors, judges, military men, agriculturists,
tradesmen, or merchants; although the concord and fast union that
should prevail between the Church and State be granted, and the fact
that we constitute here the only <i>social</i> Spanish institution,
never have we refused to contribute with our might as good patriots and
submissive vassals to whatever has been demanded of us, and which we
have been able to perform, without dishonor to our priestly and
religious character.</p>
<p><i>What they as Catholic institutions contradict.</i> All who have
written upon Filipinas consider the benefit that the country, and very
chiefly the Spanish dominion, has obtained, from that system in which
the parish priest and the missionary were the intermediary,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>more or less direct, between the public
authorities and the mass of the Filipino population. It does not belong
to us to demonstrate that, for well does the history of this
archipelago show it, and it is being told in eloquent, although tragic
voices by the present fact, with the deplorable consequences that
Espa&ntilde;a is feeling, and to which it has been guided by a
senseless and suicidal propaganda against the religious orders. What we
have to say at present is, that if the civil authority be not most
diligently attentive to the maintenance, encouragement, and guaranty of
religion and morality in the islands, as it must be through its solemn
promise contracted before the supreme pontiffs and before Christian
Europe, in accordance with the teachings and precepts of our most holy
Mother, the Church; if it do not oppose a strong wall to the avalanche
of insults, taunts, and systematic opposition to the religious of
Filipinas, which is coming down upon the peninsula and the archipelago;
if it do not prosecute the secret societies with the firmness of a
foreseeing government; if it do not cause us to be respected and held
as our quality as priests and Spanish corporations demand, in public
and in private, in all the spheres of the social order, in whatever
concerns Espa&ntilde;a and its agents, repelling every project that in
one way or another attempts to remove our prestige and to lessen our
reputation, hindering the fruit of our labors: there is no suitable and
meritorious way&mdash;and we say it with profoundest grief&mdash;in
which we can continue in the islands.</p>
<p>We cannot be less, your Excellency, in our order, than military men,
to whom their profession is an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266"
href="#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>honor and exaltation, as well
as an exaction; less than the class of administrative functionaries
whose rights and prerogatives are defended and guaranteed by the State;
less than the mercantile and industrial companies and undertakings, who
are considered and protected as impelling elements of public wealth;
less than legal, medicinal, and other professional&mdash;scientific,
artistic, or mechanical&mdash;associations, which are honored and
respected in every well-organized society. We believe, and this belief
is not at all exaggerated, that, as Catholic institutions, we have a
right to all the honors, exemptions, and privileges, that the Christian
Church and State, and the laws&mdash;in accordance with which the
religious orders were established in Filipinas&mdash;extend to
ecclesiastical persons and corporations, and especially to the
regulars; and that as Spanish institutions, we ought to have the same
consideration as the other entities that have arisen and exist under
the protection of the flag of the fatherland.</p>
<p>As Catholic institutions, we must, with all the energy of our soul,
repel, as contrary to the imprescriptible and supreme laws of the true
and the good, and to the original laws of the Church, freedom of
worship, and the other fatal and false liberties that are the offspring
of the thought, of the press, and of association, which certain men are
trying to bring to this archipelago, and which conflict with the most
rudimentary duties of the patronage that Espa&ntilde;a exercises here,
as is clearly set forth in various places in the <i lang=
"es">Recopilaci&oacute;n de Indias</i>. In like manner do we repel,
inasmuch as it contradicts the rights of the Church, the pretended
secularization of education, in accordance with what we are taught
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>in propositions 45, 47, and 48,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e4878src" href="#xd27e4878" name=
"xd27e4878src">30</a> of the <i>Syllabus</i>, and which are obligatory
on all Catholics, and very especially on Christian princes and
governments. Contrary to those rights, and entirely abusive and
tyrannical, would be every measure that the secular power might try to
adopt in regard to the religious orders of the archipelago: whether in
meddling with their regular regimen and discipline; whether in
secularizing them; whether in disentailing their property, or fettering
their free disposition of the same; whether in freeing their members
from their obedience; whether in depriving them of the honors or
privileges which they possess according to the canons, the laws of the
Indias, and Christian common law, as is expressed in proposition 53 of
the above-mentioned <i>Syllabus</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd27e4903src" href="#xd27e4903" name="xd27e4903src">31</a> Every law
that attempts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>to suppress, diminish, or weaken the sacred laws
of personal, royal, or local ecclesiastical immunity is contrary to the
sacred rules of the Church. Also contrary to the Church, and smacking
of the heresies of Wickliffe and Luther, is every ordinance that denies
the clergy the right to the stipends and fees that are due them from
their holy ministry, and that tries to meddle with matters of parochial
fees, a thing that is peculiar to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. It
is contrary to the honor and sanctity of the religious estate to
suppose it incapable of exercising the care of souls, and to say that,
in governing the parishes, we violated the canons, when in exact
accordance with them, we christianized this country, and since have
continued to minister it. It is vexatious to the regular clergy, and
opposed to the rights legitimately acquired, for the civil authority to
attempt to despoil the religious corporations of the ministries and
missions founded and ruled by them, under the protection of the
<i lang="es">Leyes de Indias</i> and the sovereign ordinances of the
apostolic see. Incompatible with the vow of obedience that binds every
religious, is the complete subjection of the individuals of the regular
clergy who discharge the care of souls to the authority of the
diocesan, depriving his prelate of the attributes that he possesses
over his subjects; and the bishop cannot be allowed, to the loss or
detriment of the rights of the regular superior <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>to
suppress the regular curacies at his pleasure, since the ministries
depend immediately on the corporation which appoints those religious
who are to fulfil the duties of them.</p>
<p><i>The need of keeping intact the authority of the regular prelate
over his curas and missionaries.</i> No one is ignorant that the
religious corporations of the archipelago are communities composed in
their vast majority of parish priests and missionaries. If that be so,
and it must be so, in order that the orders fulfil the peculiar end for
which they came to Filipinas, how could the jurisdiction of the regular
prelate he maintained, if the attributes that he has received from the
holy see, the only immediate authority to which the regulars are
subject, for the government of his subjects, of whatever class they be,
be lessened? By pontifical laws, the religious assigned to the
doctrinas and missions are considered absolutely as <i lang=
"la">viventes intra claustra</i>, which signifies that they are
governed by their peculiar superiors, rights, and attributes, which are
binding on every subject strictly conventual. If it were not so, the
individual life would be established to a greater or less extent in the
orders; their communal bonds would disappear; the regular prelates
would become mere figureheads; and the religious corporations, losing
the internal discipline that gives them so much vigor and strength,
would be converted into associations of priests [<i lang=
"es">presbiteros</i>], who although they pronounced religious vows one
day, would afterwards have no other bonds with their superiors than the
corporative habit and name, and too, perchance, the possession of the
open door in order to take refuge in the convent whence they went out,
whenever they so desired or the bishop ordered it. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>The action of the regular prelate over the curas and missionaries of
his order must be so active, immediate, energetic, and universal, that
he can change, remove, or transfer them, or give them another
occupation and appointment, and his authority over them must remain in
everything as powerful as if it were a question of the last one of the
conventual religious. That is required by the regular discipline; that
is demanded by the vow of obedience. In proportion as the attempt is
made with the individual to restrict or weaken the jurisdiction of the
order, it is equivalent to jesting at the intention of us religious,
who do not profess to be subjects of the bishop, but only to occupy
ourselves in the business of religion which our prelates assign us; it
is equivalent to disnaturalizing the religious corporations, and
consequently, to destroying them, the very thing that the separatists
are attempting.</p>
<p>Such a thing will not happen, we are sure; for the moment that a law
freeing the parish priests and missionaries from subordination to their
prelate, or lessening or restricting the latter&rsquo;s power, is
dictated, no religious, by bonds of conscience, would dare to continue
at the head of his parish or mission, and all would retire to their
convents at Manila. Such a thing will not happen, for the bishops
themselves would be energetically opposed to it, and would confess, as
they do, that precisely because the vast majority of their parish
clergy are regulars, their clergy live so morally and apply themselves
so assiduously to their ministry, and that scarcely would they find
that in secular priests [<i lang="es">presbiteros</i>] or in regulars
not fully subject to their order, and that they are consequently
interested, through love of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>their flock, in having the parish
ministries of the archipelago continue to be ruled by the same laws as
hitherto. And such a thing will not happen, we say, because the holy
see, jealous guardian of the interests of Christianity in the islands,
not less than of the prestige of the regulars, will not permit it;
while, at the last, the government would be placed in the dilemma,
namely, that either a suitable and sufficient personnel be proposed to
it, which might replace the religious corporations of Filipinas in a
stable and worthy manner, or, on the contrary, that the latter continue
discharging their actual duties, without the least diminution of the
jurisdiction of their respective regular prelates.</p>
<p><i>Espa&ntilde;a&rsquo;s obligation to send ministers of the
Catholic religion to these islands and to solidly guaranty that
religion.</i> Such a thing will not happen finally, for the government
of the country can never forget (regarding this point and the others
with which the present exposition is concerned) the will of Isabel the
Catholic, the fundamental and capital law of these dominions, by which
the government is obliged to send here prelates and religious and other
learned and austere persons of God, in order to instruct their
inhabitants in the Catholic faith, and to instruct and teach them good
morals; for nothing must be desired ahead of the publication and
extension of the evangelical law, and the conversion and conservation
of the Indians in the holy Catholic faith. &ldquo;Inasmuch as we are
directing our thought and care to this as our chief aim, we order, and
to the extent we may, charge the members of our Council of Indias that
<i>laying aside every other consideration</i> of our profit and
interest, they hold especially in mind the matters <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>of
the conversion and instruction, and above all that they be watchful and
occupy themselves with all their might and understanding in providing
and appointing ministers sufficient for it, and take all the other
measures necessary so that the Indians and natives may be converted and
conserved in the knowledge of God our Lord, the honor and praise of his
holy name, so that, we fulfilling this duty which so tightly binds us
and which we so desire to satisfy, the members of the said Council may
discharge their consciences, since we have discharged ours with
them.&rdquo; (Law i, t&iacute;t. i, book ii and law viii, t&iacute;t.

of whose devotion and zeal in fulfilling the fundamental duties of
their trust, we cannot harbor the least doubt.</p>
<p>Very expressive also to the question in hand is law lxv, t&iacute;t.

the religious of the orders resident in those provinces and occupied in
the conversion and instruction of the natives, to our entire
satisfaction, by which God has been, and is, served, and the natives
much benefited, and to honor them greatly, and encourage them to
continue, and do the same, and more, if possible, as we expect from
their persons and goodness.&rdquo;</p>

shall have with the natives of those districts to have with you some of

that the natives may recognize and understand the great consideration
in which you hold them; for seeing that and the great reverence given
them by the soldiers, they will also come to respect them. That will be
very important, so that, when the religious impart to them the matters
pertaining to our holy Catholic faith, they may give them full credit;
since you know that his Majesty&rsquo;s chiefest end is the salvation
of the souls of those infidels. For that purpose, in whatever district,
you shall take particular care to aid the said religious &hellip; so

188.)<a class="noteref" id="xd27e4997src" href="#xd27e4997" name=

<p>That is the genuinely Spanish spirit, the glory of the human race,
and especially of Christianity, which caused our legislators to write
in the <i lang="es">Partidas</i> (<i lang="es">Partida</i> i,
t&iacute;t. vi, law lxii, and t&iacute;t. xi): &ldquo;Laymen must honor
and regard the clergy greatly, each one according to his rank and his
dignity: firstly, because <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>they are mediators between God and
them; secondly, because by honoring them, they honor Holy Church, whose
servants they are, and honor the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is
their head, for they are called Christians. And this honor and this
regard must be shown in three ways; in speech; in deed; and in
counsel.&rdquo; &ldquo;The churches of the emperors, kings, and other
seigniors of the countries, have great privileges and liberties; and
these were very rightfully [given them], for the things of God should
have greater honor than those of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is the spirit that was expressed by the mouth of Felipe II when
he answered those who proposed to him the abandonment of these islands,
in consideration of the few resources that the public treasury derived
from them: &ldquo;For the conversion of only one soul of those there, I
would give all the treasures of the Indias, and were they not
sufficient I would give most willingly whatever Espa&ntilde;a yields.
Under no consideration shall I abandon or discontinue to send preachers
and ministers to give the light of the holy gospel to all and whatever
provinces may be discovered, however poor, rude, and barren they may
be, for the holy apostolic see has given to us and to our heirs the
duty possessed by the apostles of publishing and preaching the gospel,
which must be spread there and into an infinite number of kingdoms,
taking them from the power of devils and giving them to know the true
God, without any hope of temporal blessings.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Duties of the government and of others in regard to religious
interests in the islands.</i> Consequently, those offenses that should
be most prosecuted in Filipinas, and against which the government
should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>prove especially active, are offenses against
religion and against ecclesiastical persons, as such offenses are those
which wound the greatest social welfare, and are most directly opposed
to the fundamental obligation that Espa&ntilde;a contracted on
incorporating these islands with its crown. Hence, masonry, an
anti-Catholic and anti-national society, ought not to be permitted, but
punished severely; every propaganda against the dogmas, precepts, and
institutions of our holy Mother, the Church, ought to be proscribed;
outrages against the clergy and religious ought to be punished with
greater rigor than when committed against any other class of persons,
giving such outrages the character of sacrilege, which they positively
possess; all, from the governor-general to the lowest dependent of the
State, ought to exert themselves to demonstrate by their word and
example, in public and in private, and without those conventional
exteriorities of pure social form (a Catholicism that becomes naught
but mere observance and courtesy, and which, unfortunately, abounds so
widely), that they love and respect the Catholic religion, and that
they esteem more the duties toward God and toward His holy Church that
proceed from it, than any other duty and obligation, however exalted
and respectable may be the institution that imposes it.</p>
<p>Hence the government of the nation and exalted authorities must be
the first who ought to destroy, not only in their official, but in
their private acts, and as politicians, authors, government
<span class="corr" id="xd27e5024" title=
"Source: employes">employees</span>, military men, in the different
orders of social life, the ridiculous and contemptuous idea that free
thought has sown against priests and religious, permitting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>themselves to talk of them in a tone that honors
the clergy so little, and which when known by the elements of other
inferior social classes, cause respect to the Catholic priest to become
weakened daily, many judging that the religion of officials is
frequently nothing more than a social hypocrisy and a practice of pure
political convenience. Hence the government ought to very carefully see
that all its personnel in the archipelago be sincere and earnest
Catholics, in order that the sad spectacle may not be again seen, that
we have so often and so prodigally witnessed, by which the chief ones,
in opposing the apostolic labor of the religious corporations, are the
very ones, who, inasmuch as they are functionaries of a Catholic state,
ought to be those who support and strengthen it the most. Hence every
association, assembly, or undertaking which is trying to sow here
anti-religious or anti-clerical ideas, under any color or pretext, even
the exercise of political rights, ought to be prevented at all hazards
from having any representation or branch in these islands; and the
previous censorship over every kind of book, pamphlet, and engraving
that comes from outside, and over those which shall be published here,
should be restored, or better said, strengthened. Hence, the close
union of all the peninsular element here resident becomes more
necessary, so that, all united for the protection of our divine
religion, by all respected and obeyed, we may resist the enemies of the
fatherland with greater force; may not by our discords give the rebel
camp opportunity to gain strength; and as far as possible, may succeed
in elevating the moral prestige, today, unfortunately fallen so low.
Hence, likewise, is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href=
"#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>great necessity of the
disappearance in gubernatorial circles of an erroneous idea, most fatal
and extremely disrespectful to the orders, which, propagated by
sectarian spirits or by bad or lukewarm Catholics, seems now to be a
postulate of many politicians in Madrid, and of the majority of
peninsulars who come to this archipelago.</p>
<p><i>Infamous idea in regard to the importance of the orders and the
manner in which they are generally regarded.</i> We refer to the idea
which began to spread after the revolution of &rsquo;68, which looks
upon the religious of Filipinas as an evil necessity, as an archaic
institution, with which differences must be composed for reasons of
state; as a purely political resource, and a convenience to the nation,
which cannot be substituted with others. That infamous idea, manifested
at times frankly, and at times with reticence or with insinuations that
cut more deeply than a knife, is known by our declared enemies. It is
known by the natives of the country who have been in the Peninsula. It
is known, because it has been propagated in newspapers and other
products of the press that have penetrated the archipelago, by a vast
number of natives, who, with having left Filipinas, are notably
offended by it. All the peninsulars who make war on us, whether by
anti-religious prejudices, by doctrinal compromise, by personal
resentment, by flippancy, or by envy (for among all those classes do we
have enemies) help to spread and propagate that idea throughout the
islands.</p>
<p>From that idea many deduce the opinion that we are dragging out in
this country an existence of pure compassion and condescension; that we
are living <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>here, tolerated and as if on alms, instead of
honored and respected as any other institution of the mother-country;
that in many ways, one would believe that we religious are less and
have less value than the military, than the government employes, or
than those of other professions and careers; and that with wonderful
facility one imputes to us, as to the most abandoned and destitute, the
blame for all the evils that afflict the country, governors and other
representatives of the government and administration of the islands
availing themselves of our name of obliged appeal, in order to evade
and shun responsibilities, whenever any calamity comes upon them or
whenever there is any unpleasant event to bewail in their conduct. For
all, there is indulgence, for all, excuse, for all kindness and the
eyes of charity. The epoch is one of adjustment and respect for all
manner of extensions, although with the loss of morality and justice.
Only in what concerns priests and religious must one look with
contemptuous pride, with extreme rigor, and with despotic exaction. The
religious has to pay it all; on him must all the blame be cast; to him
belong the feelings of anger, the aversions, the censures, the
expressions of contempt. We appear, your Excellency, to be only the
<i lang="la">anima vilis</i><a class="noteref" id="xd27e5041src" href=
"#xd27e5041" name="xd27e5041src">35</a> of the archipelago.</p>
<p>It is evident that we, as the priestly and religious class, and as a
Spanish corporation, cannot in any manner consent to this humiliating
position, which, as private persons, obliged to greater perfection than
the generality of Christians, we endure patiently, remembering the
words of the apostle &ldquo;<i lang="la">tamquam purgamenta hujus mundi
facti sumus omnium peripsema <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href=
"#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>usque adhuc</i>,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5053src" href="#xd27e5053" name=
"xd27e5053src">36</a> and of which we would not speak if the evil were
restricted to one of so many annoyances annexed to our ministry; so
much the more as we unfortunately see that that injurious and erroneous
idea is greatly injuring our ministry, and is daily causing our
influence among the people who are entrusted to us to become lessened,
since they are assailed strongly and tenaciously by all the disturbing
agents that have caused the insurrection.</p>
<p><i>Respect that they merit as religious and as Spaniards.</i> The
religious corporations ought to be greatly honored and distinguished
(and it grieves us deeply, your Excellency, to have to speak of these
things): firstly, because their individual members are adorned with the
priestly character, which is the greatest honor and dignity among
Christians that men can have; secondly, because their apostolic mission
has here propagated and preserves the splendors of Catholicism. They
are priests and they are religious: thus they unite the two devices
that inspire the greatest veneration among any society, which feels
some needs superior to the material, or those of their proud reason
divorced from Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Not less respect do they merit in their character as Spanish
entities. Besides being here ministers of the official religion, they
are public ecclesiastical persons, recognized by the state. They live
under its safeguard, as do the military and civil entities. They have
labored, and are laboring, for the fatherland, at least as much as any
other class of Spaniards residing in the archipelago. And in the point
of intelligence, within their respective profession and of morality
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>and private and civic virtues, they rise not
only collectively, but individually, to so great a height as the class
that is considered the most high and reputable in the archipelago.</p>
<p>There is one most special reason and one of extraordinary importance
which demands that that respect should be sanctioned by the laws and
supported by customs, namely, that the religious in his respective
duties, becomes, as a general rule, the only peninsular, and,
therefore, the only representative of the mother-country in the
majority of the Filipino villages. Consequently, Spanish prestige is
greatly interested in that he be the object of such considerations and
guaranties that these inhabitants far from seeing, as unfortunately
they have not a few times seen, that he is despised and humbled, be
daily more fortified in the traditional idea that their cura or
missionary is, at once the minister of God and the representative of
Espa&ntilde;a, a lofty idea that has redounded, and redounds, so
greatly to the favor of the mother-country, and says so much in honor
of all the Spanish entities.</p>
<p>We came to the archipelago through our love to religion and
Espa&ntilde;a, and have remained in it more than three centuries, ready
to continue here so long as conscience does not dictate the contrary to
us. Gross temporal considerations do not move us, nor sentiments of
pride and of mere personal dignity. In the fulfilment of our duties, we
have striven to attain even sacrifice and by the grace of God, we shall
continue the sacrifice. A good proof of this is offered the impartial
critic by the present epoch of rebellions and insurrections. The cura
and missionaries, in spite of persuasions that they were putting their
lives <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>in great danger by the continual plots of the
ferocious Katipunan, have steadfastly maintained themselves in their
posts, foreseeing that if they abandoned their parishioners, a general
rising of the islands was almost certain. This procedure, if not
heroic, is sufficiently near it, and has cost us many victims,
snatching away our dearest brethren from us, some treacherously
assassinated and others immolated by reckless mobs seduced by
filibusters and masons. And although this sad sacrifice has seemingly
not been bewailed and appreciated, as perhaps it ought to be by the
loyal sons of Espa&ntilde;a, we trust that God, the compassionate and
generous remunerator of every good deed, will in His infinite mercy,
receive it as a propitiation for the evils of this unfortunate country,
and will have rewarded the martyrs of religion and of the
fatherland.</p>
<p><i>Character and objects of this exposition.</i> May the nation,
government, and your Excellency, pardon this slight extension of our
sentiments of dignity, offended as religious and as Spaniards. This is
not a memorial of merits and services, since we have never solicited
applause or recompense, which never constitute the lever of our labors.
Neither is it a panegyric, which we are not called upon to make, and
which we do not believe is wanting, since the history of the religious
corporations of Filipinas detaches itself so patiently and cleanly in
all kinds of just and upright progress. It contains some apologetic
matter and much of most sensible complaint because of the unjustifiable
injuries that almost daily are received by us. It is the weak
expression of the profound bitterness that seizes upon us at
contemplating and viewing from anear the condition of vast disturbance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>in which this beautiful portion of the
fatherland finds itself. With the utmost respect and submission, laying
aside absolutely whatever proceeds from political parties and much more
from private persons, it tells the government with Christian simplicity
and synthetically that it should adopt and maintain a perfectly logical
criterion with regard to the religious corporations of Filipinas; and
that, therefore, if it thinks, as is just and decorous, that we, the
religious corporations, exercise a most lofty and necessary mission in
the archipelago, honorable and worthy of the greatest consideration, of
its own accord and without utilitarian considerations and false reasons
of state, it so manifest clearly and with nobility, making a beginning
by giving a practical example of that in its laws and decrees, and in
its instructions to the authorities of these islands, and that it do
not allow us to be annoyed or insulted; and so much the more since
being weak and helpless, and bound as we are by religious weakness and
patience, we have no other means of defense than our right and the
protection of the good, and we can never appeal to the means of
repression and influence to which we allude in the beginning of this
expository statement.</p>
<p>But if the government, on the contrary, by an error that we would
respect, not without qualifying it, in our humble judgment, as most
fatal to the interests of religion and the fatherland, should believe
that the religious have terminated their traditional mission here, let
it also have the frankness to say so. We shall listen to its resolution
calmly. But let it not imagine, in adopting measures which, attaching,
although without claiming it, the privileges of the Church, our
profession as priests and regulars, and our honor as refined Spaniards,
that in practice it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283"
name="pb283">283</a>]</span>might appear that it was trying to burn one
candle to Christ and another to Belial, that it was trying to please
masons and Catholics, good patriots and separatists, by placing the
orders in a so graceless situation that they might become like the
mouthful that was thrown into the jaws of the wild beast in order to
silence its roars for the time being.</p>
<p><i>Synthesis of the same.</i> Such would happen if the
secularization of the regular ministries; the secularization of
education; the disamortization of the property of the corporations, or
the expression of the liberty that belongs to them to enjoy and dispose
of them; the declaration of the tolerance of worship; the establishment
of civil marriage; the permission of every kind of association; and the
liberty of the press became law. Such would happen, in what more
directly concerns us, if the government continuing here and there its
campaign against us, unjustifiable from every point of view, were to
show by its acts that it actually conceives that we have been the cause
of the insurrection, and that we are opposed to the progress of these
islands, and to the unfolding of their legitimate aspirations. Such
would happen, if the government, failing to rigorously prosecute secret
societies, and to effectively correct the seditious ones who are
exciting the ignorant masses of the people against the regulars and
against all that is most holy and Spanish in the islands, should desire
the religious to continue in their ministries, liable at any moment to
be sacrificed, as is the terrible watchword of the sect, and which has
already unfortunately occurred, without, perhaps, their having even the
consolation that those sacrifices are appreciated.</p>
<p>If we religious are to continue to be of use in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>the
islands to religion and Espa&ntilde;a, no one can have any doubt that
it must be by thoroughly guarantying our persons, our prestige, and our
ministry, it must be by knowing that the fatherland appreciates and
treats us as its sons, and that it must not abandon us as an object of
derision to our enemies, and as victims to the rancor of masonry and
separatism. Martyrdom does not terrify us, but only honors us, although
we do not consider ourselves worthy of so holy an honor: but we do not
desire to die as if criminals, enveloped with the censures of friends
and enemies, and perhaps, abandoned and despised by those who ought to
protect and esteem us.</p>
<p>That is the extremely gloomy and graceless situation in which the
orders find themselves, especially since the beginning of the
Tag&aacute;rog insurrection, and above all, since the extension of the
Katipunan, a situation that threatens to become worse, if the
government becomes the echo of the filibusters, of the masons, of the
radical elements, which, it seems, have conspired together to give the
finishing stroke to the great social-religious edifice, raised in these
islands by Catholic Espa&ntilde;a.</p>
<p>By that no one should be surprised that we religious, placed in so
imminent a peril, desirous of not offering abstracts to the policy of
any government, and of avoiding the censure that we are the cause of
the evils of the country and the bar to its progress, should choose the
abandonment of our ministries, exile, and expatriation, in preference
to our continuance in the islands in a situation, which, if prolonged
for a longer time, will result as decidedly dishonoring to our class,
and would make our permanence in the archipelago unfruitful.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span></p>
<p>We have fulfilled our duty here as good men; such is our firm
conviction. Should we go elsewhere, there, by the grace of God, we
shall also be able to fulfil our duty. And for that result, the holy
see, if contrary to all our just expectations, it cannot succeed in
making itself heard by the Spanish nation, will not deny us the
opportune permission.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have trust in the noble sentiments and deeply-rooted
Catholicism of her Majesty, the queen regent; we trust in the devotion
and patriotism of the ministers of the crown; we trust in the sensible
opinion shared by the majority of the Spanish people; we trust in the
intelligence and spirit of justice of the Catholic minister of the
colonies; and we trust that, after listening to the most dignified
prelates of these islands, and after taking into consideration the
prescriptions of natural and canonical law, the exalted advantages of
the fatherland in these regions, and the undeniable services that the
religious orders in Filipinas have contributed, no resolution contrary
to the teachings and precepts of our holy Mother, the Church, will be
adopted, and which is contrary to the prestige of the regular clergy,
but that, on the contrary, the Catholic institutions of this
archipelago will be once more affirmed and strengthened, as is imposed
by both religion and the fatherland.</p>
<p>In this confidence, and reiterating our traditional adhesion to the
throne, and to its institutions, we conclude, praying God for the
prosperity and new progress of the monarchy, for the health of his
Majesty, the king, and of her Majesty, the queen regent (whom may God
preserve), and for prudence of the Cortes and the government in their
resolutions, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=

first Filipino freemason lodge in the Philippines was founded in Cavite
about 1860 by two Spanish naval officers under the name of Luz
Filipina. It was established under the auspices of the Gran Oriente
Lusitana, and was in correspondence with the Portuguese lodges at Macao
and Hong-Kong. Gradually other lodges were established and natives and
mestizos were admitted to membership. The &ldquo;Gran Oriente&rdquo; of
the text is the Spanish division of the order, Spain and Portugal
having split into two divisions after 1860. It is claimed by Catholics
that the Katipunan was the fighting branch of the masonic order. It is
probably true that it borrowed some few things from freemasonry in
matters of form, but there the analogy seems to end. For the friar

Ayer collection is a document dated Manila, January 17, 1888, by one
Candido Garcia, a native Filipino, an inhabitant of San Felipe Neri, in
which he complains against the friar parish priest Gregorio Chagra,
O.S.F., who has endeavored to have him deported as anti-Spanish. The
reason of this is because Garcia had complained that the friar
disobeyed the law in regard to burials as well as other laws. He also
accuses the friars of not wishing to have the Filipinos learn Spanish,
as they desire them to have no communication with Spaniards. He thus
charges the friars with disobedience and disloyalty.&nbsp;<a class=

statement by the pope of errors condemned in 1864, and known under the
title <i lang="la">Syllabus errorum</i>. It was appended to the
encyclical <i lang="la">Quanta cura</i>, condemning eighty doctrines,
which it calls &ldquo;the principal errors of our times.&rdquo; These
heresies had all previously been pointed out by Pius IX in consistorial
allocutions, and encyclical and other apostolic letters. It is a
protest against atheism, materialism, and other forms of infidelity. It
condemns religious and civil liberty, separation of Church and State,
and pre&euml;minence of the Church of Rome. See Philip Schaff&rsquo;s

1474, and died in Madrid, in July, 1569, and because of his great
exertions for the Indians called the &ldquo;apostle of the
Indies.&rdquo; Much has been written concerning this romantic and
sincere character of early American history. He wrote various books,
some of which have been published. Mr. Ayer of Chicago possesses one
volume in MS. of his three-volume <i lang="es">Historia general de

<p class="first"><i>A decree by Basco in 1784</i></p>
<p>Don Joseph Basco y Vargas, Balderrama y Rivera, knight of the Order
of Santiago, commander of a division in the royal navy, governor and
captain-general of these Filipinas Islands and president of their royal
Audiencia and Chancilleria, commander-in-chief of the troops of his
Majesty in these dominions, general superintendent of the royal
treasury, and of the royal revenue from tobacco, and delegate
superintendent of that from the mail service, etc.</p>
<p>[The author begins by showing the importance, necessity, and
advantage of agriculture to both the state and the individual, with
illustrations drawn from history and observation in various countries
of the world, and continues:]</p>
<p>Since agriculture is so necessary for the subsistence of mankind,
and the maintenance of kingdoms, it is not wonderful that it should be
so cared for by the wise and by kings, and that the lawmakers of
nations should have ennobled this pursuit with special privileges.
Especially have been distinguished in this direction the Spanish
monarchs, who, besides other privileges granted in favor of the
farmers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>have thought it well to decree that neither the
implements for their labors, nor their lands, should be taken from them
for any civil debt; and also they granted to these laborers the
privilege that they could not be imprisoned for any civil debt in the
season for their harvesting and field labors, authorizing the superior
judges to grant them delay in such cases. But besides these so useful
and valuable benefits the natives of Filipinas enjoy still others more
extraordinary. For their security, besides having ordained that their
goods shall not be seized for costs in lawsuits, nor shall they be
punished with pecuniary fines, conferring upon them other favors of the
same kind, it has been likewise commanded that no one may lend money to
them above the sum of five pesos, under the penalty of losing what is
lent them beyond that. In all these things the monarchs have sought to
release the farmers from many oppressions and injuries, and to prevent
the losses and deficits which otherwise, for most of the vassals, are
caused by caring for the interests and profits of a few individuals.
But it occasions the greatest sorrow that in Filipinas, contrary to the
pious and Christian intention of our kings&mdash;and especially that of
the wise monarch, who is now prosperously governing us, our lord Don
Carlos III (whom may God preserve)&mdash;Spaniards should have acted,
in regard to these exemptions, without any heed or consideration for
the injuries which have resulted here to the Indians and their
agriculture, and with notable loss of the wealth which the fertility
and valuable products of this country promise.</p>
<p>And since this chief executive, actuated by what he himself has
observed in this province of Pampanga, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>in that of Bulacan,
and in those of Tondo and Laguna de Bay (which he has visited
personally), cannot any longer permit such extortions and injuries as
are caused, among all classes of persons, to the farmers and poor
Indians in the said provinces, and in the other districts to which this
decree will also be made to extend: I command that in future the
implements of labor&mdash;such as carabaos, plows, hemp-combs, and
other field utensils belonging to the Indians, mestizos, creoles,
Spaniards, or any other class of persons&mdash;shall not be seized for
a civil debt, any more than their lands, since most of them have no
ownership in these. Moreover, they shall not be arrested at the times
when they must work in the fields, such as plowing, and gathering their
harvests: and, at the times when they can be arrested, authority shall
be given to the alcaldes-mayor so that they can grant them a respite of
six months, without loading them with fees or other exactions.</p>
<p>And, as the backward state of agriculture in Filipinas proceeds also
from the fact that, notwithstanding there are many industrious,
laborious and charitable persons in the villages, there are also many
others in whom sloth and idleness reign&mdash;for instance, many chiefs
and their sons, and the heads of barangay; and generally these who have
exercised the office of magistrate (who, on account of having served in
these employments, afterward refuse through a sort of vanity and pride
to go back to field work), all these caring only to subjugate the
common people by compelling them to work without pay in their fields,
and trying to exempt themselves from the common labor, and from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=

subject&mdash;likewise this chief executive has resolved to declare
that such exemptions ought not to be understood for the classes of
persons who are mentioned above, unless they possess at least eight
cabalitas of their own land cultivated and worked by their servants or
day-laborers, expressly forbidding that they rent these lands to
others&mdash;always provided that they are not prevented by age or
infirmities from carrying on their farm-work in person, since in this
case they are allowed to rent them.</p>
<p>And although, in regard to the contract of <i>casamajan</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5255src" href="#xd27e5255" name="xd27e5255src">1</a>
which they commonly practice, absolute prohibition ought to be made to
them on account of the burden which ensues from it to the poor, and
also to their own consciences, on account of the many usurious acts
which are committed therein, [yet] considering, as has been already
stated, that there will be many who, on account of age and sickness,
cannot themselves attend to the cultivation of their land, this chief
executive consents to grant such persons a contract of that sort, under
the condition that whatever loan is made to the farmers by their
partners, it shall be in the form of palay, and they shall collect it
in the same; that is, if they shall lend, for example, four cavans [of
rice], they shall receive four others. And the same is ordained in
regard to money, so that if they shall lend, for example, two pesos
they shall receive only two pesos; and, if they shall lend cloth, if it
is not returned they may only receive its just value at the time when
the bargain was made&mdash;under the penalty that no judge shall admit
any claim in contravention of this ordinance, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>and
the complainants shall lose what they had lent.</p>
<p>Besides this, I have in the same manner heard of the unjust and vile
bargains which the usurers make in regard to the cultivated lands, and
even the trees which the farmers cultivate in their gardens, and their
houses, binding them with the agreement of <i lang=
"es">retrovendendi</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5265src" href=
"#xd27e5265" name="xd27e5265src">2</a> as it is commonly called,
exacting from him who is bound&mdash;sometimes for many years, and
sometimes forever&mdash;the produce and the ownership [of those
possessions], for a small amount which the lender has furnished. They
also exact a premium for the money which they lend, sometimes in
valuables, and sometimes besides these. This is done by a multitude of
usurers who overrun the island, with great offense to God and injury to
their neighbors. In order to redress such evils, which provoke divine
justice against the islands, this chief executive has also resolved to
ordain that in future such contracts shall not be made, either by
writing or in words; for they are null and void, and usurious. And we
forbid all the magistrates of these islands to give hearing to any
claim arising from these contracts; if they contravene this order, they
remain responsible for all losses and injuries, with the penalty,
besides, of a fine of five hundred pesos.</p>
<p>Besides this, the inhabitants of all the islands ought to have
understood that the lands which they obtained are all royal [<i lang=
"es">realengas</i>] or communal, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296"
href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>with the exception of those
which they possess through inheritance, or through legitimate purchase
from the native chiefs [<i lang="es">caciques</i>] who were cultivating
them at the time when the Catholic faith was established in Filipinas,
and when they rendered fidelity, obedience, and vassalage to the august
Spanish monarchs; and of those which were purchased from his Majesty
with title of ownership from the royal Audiencia. [They should also
understand] that for this reason the royal lands cannot be absolutely
sold or alienated, since they only enjoy the use and usufruct of them;
consequently, those who fail to cultivate them for the years appointed
by the Audiencia lose this right of use, and the magistrates ought to
assign these lands immediately to another person. As for the rest of
the lands, no one can obtain them except by right of purchase and
agreement with the tribunal of indults and compositions<a class=
"noteref" id="xd27e5286src" href="#xd27e5286" name="xd27e5286src">3</a>
of lands, which his Majesty has established <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>for
this purpose. In the same manner, the lands which they hold by this
tenure, as those inherited, or purchased from native chiefs, they
cannot sell without the intervention of the court of justice. For this
reason, warning is given that in the house-lots of the villages also
they have no more than the use of the land; on this account, whenever
the term of three years has passed without those who had formerly lived
on them building houses on these lots, it has been and is the duty of
the court to assign these lots to other persons&mdash;without allowing
or accepting lawsuit or claim, when this neglect is evident, either
through general report or by the verbal deposition of witnesses who
have resided there a long time and are conscientious; for these
house-lots are common property of the villages in which they are
located, and for this reason the ownership of them cannot be sold,
because this title does not belong to those who dwell in them. In
regard to this matter, and with observation and knowledge of the
injuries connected with it, this chief executive (having been actually
present in this, province of Pampanga, and in the others that have been
named) likewise ordains that the house and house-lot cannot be seized
from any debtor, of whatever class he may be, as is commonly
done&mdash;leaving in the street, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>exposed to beggary
and other evils, a multitude of Indians who perhaps would again be
self-supporting, if they could have recourse to their own sheltering
roof (which hardly would be worth as much as ten pesos), and the trees
which they enjoyed on their own land. Proceedings must be taken only
against their goods, without leaving them or their wives destitute; for
it is very well known (as those who lend ought to know) that no one can
lend to a native more than five pesos&mdash;an amount which he can
easily pay with his work, or with some article of luxury which he may
possess. This regulation must serve for the magistrates, as they are
ordained and commanded, in order that they may conform to it; and, in
virtue of the ordinance by his Majesty that in cases involving from one
to five hundred pesos formal claim shall not be brought into court, the
alcaldes-mayor shall decide these verbally, without receiving formal
complaints, or anything else except the [original] documents, or the
verbal declaration or confrontation of the parties. It must be noted
that in cases where this is necessary, and the complaining party shall
name some valuable article which is worth the amount of his demand, the
magistrate shall proceed to sell it in the public square; and by
selling it to the highest bidder, in one day (which shall be announced
by the public crier), payment shall be made to the claimant, handing
over the rest to the debtor, and deducting only such fees as are proper
for the few hours of time which the judge may have spent on the case.
By this, however, must be understood that in such cases their wooden
houses which may have some value (as they actually do in most of the
villages) shall not remain exempt from seizure; for it is certain that
the owners of such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299"
name="pb299">299</a>]</span>houses, if through ill-luck or calamity
they come to misfortune, can never lack some means among their own
relatives for establishing themselves in some humble house, which they
can erect as cheaply as I have just stated.</p>
<p>In regard to the repartimientos of people for the royal works, which
are constructed in the provinces near Manila, as also in regard to the
domestic servants [<i lang="es">tanores</i>], and other people who are
assigned for work on the churches, government buildings, and jails, and
guards [<i lang="tl">bantayes</i>], etc., various regulations have been
made; but, knowing that these are not sufficient to uproot so many
wrongs, injuries and oppressions as the Indians suffer from the
magistrates of their villages, and from the heads of
barangay&mdash;making the villages contribute a greater number of
people than is needed and required, and exempting from their turn of
service those who should render it (both of these proceedings serving
to defraud the poor, who, in order not to leave their grain fields,
yield whatever the magistrates and chiefs ask from them, according to
their caprice and the extent of their greed)&mdash;it is ordained and
commanded that both these repartimientos be carried out with the
knowledge and consent of the parish curas. To each individual cura must
be sent a statement of the number of people necessary, and of the quota
from each village; and the headmen shall be under strict obligation to
obtain certificates from the said father curas that they have carried
out the repartimiento in conformity with the decrees. It must be
understood that these repartimientos cannot be made in conscience, and
without contravention of the law, among the farmers and artisans who
are occupied in their tasks, so long as there are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>wandering and idle people, since these last are
the ones assigned by the law for these necessities. As little are the
sons of the chief exempt, or the heads of barangay who have no
occupation, or those who have held an official position, if, relying on
this sort of privilege, they do not return to their former occupation
or duties in the field.</p>
<p>Finally, it is ordained and commanded to all the governors,
corregidors, alcaldes-mayor, and other magistrates throughout the
island, that they most punctually observe and fulfil whatever is here
decreed, in order thus to render greater service to God, and to the
king&mdash;who has entrusted to the carefulness, conscience and
vigilance of this supreme government the welfare of these islands and
of all their inhabitants; also their social condition, just government,
promotion, and reputation. And the said governors, corregidors,
alcaldes-mayor and other magistrates here mentioned are warned to
fulfil whatever is here decreed, under a penalty of five hundred pesos
fine; and on the alcaldes of the natives, the mestizos, and others of
their class a fine of twenty pesos is imposed, both fines to be applied
in the usual manner. These fines shall be exacted from them whenever
any application shall be presented that is founded upon any
transgression of this decree, or when its infraction shall be proved in
any manner. And as it is necessary that the parish priests shall aid,
on their side, and shall be zealous for its fulfilment, the reverend
and illustrious archbishops and bishops and the devout provincials of
the islands shall be urgently requested to incite and oblige their
parish priests to the observance of these wholesome regulations and
ordinances, charging upon their consciences that if they know of any
failure to observe the decree, they shall communicate <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>it
to the supreme government. The said reverend prelates shall also be
notified that this supreme government expects&mdash;from their
well-known zeal and love for their flocks, and because they have
resigned all else for the greater service of God and of the
king&mdash;that they will co&ouml;perate by their utterances and with
their effective persuasions in fulfilling by all means the desires and
intentions of the governor, who considers himself under the strictest
obligation to issue this ordinance, and to command that it be carried
out until his Majesty shall be pleased to confirm it. Before his royal
throne will be presented the merit and activity of each one of those
who excel in solicitude for its observance, a full account of which
will be given to his Majesty in our next despatches. And, in order that
this decree may be known in all the villages and in all the districts
of the island, and published with all possible fulness and clearness,
it shall be translated into all the dialects; and as many copies as
shall be necessary shall be printed, in two columns, the first in
Castilian, and the second in the respective idiom of the province to
which it shall be sent. Copies of these shall be posted everywhere in
the magistrates&rsquo; offices of the villages, and printed copies
shall be supplied to all the courts of the capital, in order that they
may observe and fulfil the decree, so far as it belongs to them.</p>

<p><i>Agricultural conditions in 1866</i></p>
<p>[The following article is taken from Jagor&rsquo;s <i lang=
"de">Reisen</i>, pp. 303&ndash;306.]</p>
<p>Excepting some large estates acquired in earlier times through
donation, landed property originated mainly through the right of
occupation by the possessor and his rendering the land productive which
even now is a common right recognized in the laws of the Indias in
favor of the indigenous inhabitants. In the exercise of this right, the
native takes possession of such unused land as is necessary for his
house and tilled fields, and loses it only when it remains uncultivated
for two years. Setting aside these native (and likewise very poor)
landed proprietors, landed property is legally acquired in the
following manner: through purchase from the state of a certain area of
unimproved crown lands [Spanish, <i lang="es">realengas</i>]; through
actual purchase from the natives who possess property; through
contracts (called <i lang="es">pactos de retro</i>) concluded with the
natives; and through the pledging or hypothecation of bonds, which even
these natives are accustomed to agree to, especially in commercial
dealings.</p>
<p>The first of these means ought to be a source of wealth; but it is
not, for various reasons. At present very few persons are familiar with
the legislation regarding the unused crown land, which consists of
numberless single decrees forming a casuistical, disconnected,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>complicated, and confused mass&#8202;&hellip;.
By a royal order of 1857, the first offer for untilled crown lands was
fixed at fifty dollars a qui&ntilde;on; and the concession could not be
secured without a previous public auction. From that time private
persons held aloof from such demands; to the former evils are added the
high price, and the danger of being outbidden in the auction, and thus
of losing one&rsquo;s trouble and expense for the examination of the
lands. In 1859 the decree was modified, and the former price of four
reals a qui&ntilde;on as first offer was established; but this decree
is not yet published.</p>
<p>In order that capital may flow into agriculture&mdash;without which
that industry cannot possibly be developed to the production of grain
and colonial products for exportation&mdash;it is absolutely necessary
to overcome all obstacles which discourage men of wealth. Among these
hindrances stands in the first rank the local administration, in regard
to the granting of untilled crown lands; in the second, the
obstructions which are placed in the way of both [Spanish] natives and
foreigners who wish to acquire rights of settlement and citizenship in
the community. Besides the difficulty of acquiring large possessions,
still others exist. The planter can easily find laborers, to whom he
must make considerable advances in food, cattle, and money; but the
Indians pay little attention to fulfilling their contracts, and the
legal means at the command of the planter for compelling them to
fulfill their past engagements are as burdensome and ruinous as even
the abandonment of his rights. Unless the alcalde is active and shows
good-will, the planters usually prefer not to press their claims; they
endure the loss, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304"
name="pb304">304</a>]</span>and many are thus induced to abandon their
enterprises. This cancer on agriculture will disappear as soon as every
Indian possesses a certificate of citizenship [<i lang=
"de">B&uuml;rgerbrief</i>; Spanish, <i lang="es">c&eacute;dula de
vecindad</i>]. If one weathers the first year, storms, locusts, and
business crises are to be expected later, all of which depress the
price of his product. In such cases it is for the planter the greatest
evil that no credit exists. There are no mortgages, at least there is
no compulsory registration of mortgages; accordingly, no one dares to
lend his money on such estates, or he does it only at crushing rates of
usurious interest. An improvement in this respect is urgently demanded
by the agricultural interests, both great and small, by the mercantile
class, and by large and small estates; it would place a limit to the
<i lang="es">pacto de retro</i>, as well as to the usurious contracts
which are called in Luzon <i lang="tl">tacalanan</i>, in Bisaya
<i>alili</i>&mdash;the furnishing of loans on the proceeds of the next
harvest&mdash;to which must be ascribed the misery and the backward
conditions that prevail in many places&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">pacto de retro</i> is one of the most usual modes
in which landed property passes from the possession of the natives to
others. A considerable part of Pampanga, Bataan, Manila, Laguna,
Batangas, and other provinces has, within a few years, changed owners
in this way. Thus also do the inexpressibly cunning and thrifty
mestizos usually acquire their landed possessions, the cultivation of
which they then improve; but that does not prevent this custom from
being detrimental to the public welfare. The native who possesses a
piece of land through placing it under cultivation and actually
occupying it, but almost never (or very seldom) by purchase from
another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>owner, when he finds himself in pressing need of
money offers his land as a pledge for the desired loan from a
capitalist; but where he has no document to establish and prove his
just claim, no foundation exists for a loan on mortgage under moderate
conditions, since the applicant is free from all burdens and
obligations. The capitalist therefore looks for his own security in
immediate possession. The hypotheca is converted into an antichresis
security (<i lang="es">prenda pretoria</i>), and as it is with great
difficulty (or at least it very seldom occurs), that the Indian who
receives the money consents to pay it back at the appointed time, and
it is not to the lender&rsquo;s interest to force him to pay it, the
result is, that for a sum corresponding to the secured loan&mdash;that
is, for a half or a third of the value of the security&mdash;the piece
of land finally changes proprietors. Not seldom it happens that the
former proprietor remains on the land as a farmer (that is, as a
laborer, in reality as a slave to his debts). Often the Indian is
seduced into contracts of this sort by his passion for cockfighting and
gambling.</p>
<p>The laws of the country require the Indians to live in villages,
uniting their farms into hamlets, so that they can be watched over and
their tributes collected. In ordinary circumstances, the Indian builds
for himself a hut in his field, where he lives while he is working his
land, and goes on Saturday evenings to the village in order to hear
mass on Sunday. His field has no great value for him, since he can
always put another piece of land into cultivation, so great is the
surplus of land in all the villages remote from the capital. The
facility with which he can abandon one tract to take possession of
another is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>very detrimental to the development of
agriculture. A small landed proprietor, who has planted a bit of waste
land with rice or potatoes without asking any one&rsquo;s permission,
raises an outcry if his garden is entered by a cow or a horse that
grazed there years ago; and, since the law stands in his favor, he is
allowed to receive from the owner of the cattle payment for often
imaginary damages, while the loss from such causes should be borne by
him who cultivates a field without enclosing it.</p>
<p>This same small proprietor avails himself for his own benefit, of
all the privileges and rights of an entire village of Indians, if a
wealthy man desires to lay out a plantation in his neighborhood. The
capitalist who has decided on such a plan often finds that on land
which was before entirely unfilled and waste, when he has after long
difficulties acquired control of his property, and has reckoned a
certain amount [of expense], some Indians have planted a grain field;
and through testimonies covered with signatures, which are presented in
the court, they assert that they inherited these very lands from their
fathers, and have never ceased to work them.</p>
<p>A remedy for these abuses would consist in the limitation of
districts, and the jurisdiction of the municipality, so that, for the
purpose of increasing the landed property for the inhabitants of a
village, so much land should remain free as they could at the time
reasonably claim&mdash;more or less than the so-called municipal field
(<i lang="es">legua comunal</i>), of which, besides, no law makes
mention. All the remaining land located within the jurisdiction should
be declared the property of the crown, and the title to all possessions
then located outside of municipal control <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>should be valid; but
in future all possessions that shall not conform to the said rules
shall be declared invalid. Within the municipal limits or the legal
property of the village (which may not extend beyond the sound of the
bell) the native farmer should be allowed to dwell, [even] outside of
the village, in the midst of the lands cultivated by him; and only in
case he alienates or abandons these should he be compelled to live in
the village. The natives should bring new plots under cultivation
within the municipality, and be able to acquire these by paying to the
communal treasury a small ground-rent, or a moderate sum once for all.
Such grants should proceed, with all publicity, from the entire body of
the notables, with the cooperation of the parish priest, and be
recorded in a safely-kept book in every village, and should never
contain a greater area than the applicant can till with his own
carabaos [<i lang="de">B&uuml;ffeln</i>]. If such grant of state land
does not exceed a quin&otilde;n, it should be issued, according to the
aforesaid forms, by the alcalde<a class="noteref" id="xd27e5412src"
href="#xd27e5412" name="xd27e5412src">5</a> of the province; if of
greater extent, in the capital of the colony; but all ought to be
recorded in the land-register of the province and village concerned.
Those measures that were taken for the benefit of the natives and the
promotion of cattle-raising, but which have an opposite effect, ought
to be abolished. Agriculture, like every other occupation, needs no
protection save clearness and security in its essential conditions of
life.</p>

<p>Founded in the year 1781, in virtue of a royal order dated August 27
in the preceding year (issued in consequence of advices from the
excellent governor Don Jos&eacute; Basco y Vargas), in 1787 it
suspended its meetings on account of the gradual and progressive
decline of the society. In 1819 it resumed its functions, but suffered
a period of discouragement and paralysis as a result of the Asiatic
cholera morbus, which appeared then for the first time in these
islands; and until October, 1822, the few meetings which the society
held had no other object than questions of internal order, having
little interest or importance for its history.<a class="noteref" id=

valuable, inasmuch as they proceeded from slight and ephemeral causes,
and from a corporation which could not depend on material resources
even remotely proportioned to the magnitude of its object; and which
plunged into labors [which meant] nothing less than the advancement and
civilization of a virgin country, containing more than 8,000 square
leguas of surface, with 3,000,000 of inhabitants still half-barbarous,
and without stable or established mercantile relations with any part of
the world (on account of the recent crisis in the privileged commerce,
which bad just been abolished), with a capital of 30,000 pesos, at
5,000 leguas distance from European civilization, and with a government

the aggrandizement and prosperity of the country.&rdquo; In the above

<p>In this interesting account of meritorious deeds we have omitted, in
order not to make it too long, the numerous reports sent out by the
society for draining marshes, loans of money for promoting agriculture
and the mechanic arts, rewards to literary works, etc. We should state
that at present [in 1875] the society holds the meetings provided for
in its by-laws; and that each member, in order to defray in part the
expenses of the corporation, contributes annually twelve pesos from his
own funds. We do not doubt that it will continue its vigilant efforts,
in order to realize, as far as possible its motto, &ldquo;Public
felicity.&rdquo; The chronological record of its resolutions from 1822
to 1860 also forms a memorial of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

&ldquo;composition&rdquo; (Spanish, <i lang=

meaning as applied to lands, and may be defined as a method by which
the State enabled an individual who held its lands without legal title
thereto to convert his mere possession into a perfect right of property
by virtue of compliance with the requirements of law. Composition was
made in the nature of a compact or compromise between the State and the
individual who was illegally holding lands in excess of those to which
he was legally entitled, and, by virtue of his compliance with the law,
the State conferred on him a good title to the lands that he had
formerly held under a mere claim of title.&rdquo; Under Spanish
administration, there was great confusion and uncertainty in
land-titles; the laws in force were too complicated and slow in
operation, and left too much power in the hands of indifferent or
mercenary officials. Some benefits were yielded by regulations for the
composition of State lands which were in force from 1880 to 1894, and
in the latter year more definite and positive provisions were made by
royal decree (constituting the &ldquo;public-land law&rdquo; in force
in the islands when occupied by the United States) for the settlement
of uncertain land-titles; but in neither case were the results very
satisfactory. The same may be said of the registration system known as
the <i lang="es">Ley hipotecaria</i> (or mortgage law), which in 1889
was extended to Filipinas. During the period of revolution and war
(1896&ndash;99) many of the land records were destroyed in the
provinces, which further complicated questions of land ownership; and
the U. S. Philippine Commission was obliged to make provision for the
settlement of these by the &ldquo;Land Registration Act,&rdquo; which
became effective on February 1, 1903. For account of its provisions and
mode of operation, see the chapter on &ldquo;Land Titles&rdquo; (pp.

was Paul de la Gironi&egrave;re, a French surgeon who went to Manila in
1820, and who escaped, almost by a miracle, from the massacre of
foreigners by the natives in that year. He married a Spanish lady of
Manila, the Marquesa de las Salinas, and spent twenty years in the
islands, where he founded a colony at Jala-Jala, and kept a large
estate under cultivation, besides performing, at various times,
official functions entrusted to him by the Manila government. He
returned to France, where he died about 1865. He was author of a book,
<i lang="fr">Aventures d&rsquo;un gentilhomme breton aux &icirc;les
Philippines</i> (Paris, 1855), which had considerable vogue, and is
regarded as an interesting and in many respects valuable description of
the islands, their resources and people, and social conditions there.
He also wrote <i lang="fr">Vingt ann&eacute;es aux Philippines</i>
(Paris, 1853), of which an English abridgment was published in London
soon afterward, called <i>Twenty Years in the Philippines</i>. (See
Pardo de Tavera, <i lang="es">Biblioteca filipina</i>, pp.

Jagor&rsquo;s chapter (<i lang="de">Reisen</i>, pp. 309, 310) on the
opium monopoly which was established in Filipinas on Jan. 1, 1844, and
later continued by the Spanish government, after much discussion and
controversy. Various arguments of policy, health, and morality were
brought forward on both sides, but that which finally triumphed was
evidently the one thus stated by the governor-general, &ldquo;The
revenue from opium is indispensable for our treasury.&rdquo; The use of
opium in the islands was intended for the Chinese residing there (being
forbidder to the Indians and mestizos), and then only under certain
restrictions; but Jagor found that, besides the 478 public
opium-joints&mdash;which were &ldquo;actual hotbeds of immorality, and
always full of Chinese&rdquo;&mdash;hundreds of individuals were
allowed, contrary to the law and to the intentions of the government,
to smoke opium in their own houses. The revenue from opium amounted in
1860 to 98,000 escudos; in the fiscal year of 1865&ndash;66, to
140,000; and in 1866&ndash;67, to 207,000. Montero y Vidal cites in
<i lang="es">Archipi&eacute;lago filipino</i> (published in 1886), the
tariff schedule of 1874, &ldquo;The importation of opium is prohibited;
and only that will be allowed which, in small quantities, is destined
for the pharmacies, and all that which may be imported by the lessees
of the right to sell this drug to whom the Treasury has granted that
exclusive right in the provinces there&mdash;in which case it will pay

botanical garden of Manila was created by Governor Norzagaray (by
decree of Sept. 13, 1858); and, as a result of this, a royal decree of
May 29, 1861, founded there a school o&pound; botany and agriculture,
under the control of the governor of the islands and immediate
supervision of the Economic Society. The locality called Campo de
Arroceros [&ldquo;the rice-dealers&rsquo; field&rdquo;] was set apart
as a botanical garden, for the practical work of that school, with
approval of the expenditures incurred by the governor for the
establishment of both institutions; and the sum of 6,000 pesos a year
was allowed for their maintenance. (In 1894&ndash;95, the budget
included for the expenses of these two establishments the sum of 37,294
pesos.) See Montero y Vidal, <i lang="es">Hist. de Filipinas</i>, iii,

Worcester says of the Ifugaos (<i lang="la">ut supra</i>, p. 829):
&ldquo;Their agriculture is little short of wonderful, and no one who
has seen their dry stone dams, their irrigating ditches running for
miles along precipitous hillsides and even crossing the faces of
cliffs, and their irrigated terraces extending for thousands of feet up
the mountain sides, can fail to be impressed (Pl. xxvi, xxxvii). When
water must be carried across cliffs so hard and so broken that the
Ifugaos cannot successfully work the stone with their simple tools,
they construct and fasten in place great troughs made from the hollowed
trunks of trees, and the same procedure is resorted to when
ca&ntilde;ons must be crossed, great ingenuity being displayed in
building the necessary supporting trestle-work of timber. The nearly
perpendicular walls of their rice paddies are usually built of stone,
although near Quiangan, where the country is comparatively open and
level, walls of clay answer the same purpose, and are used. The stone
retaining walls are sometimes forty feet high, and so steep are the
mountain sides that the level plots gained by building such walls and
filling in behind them are often not more than twenty or thirty feet
wide. I know of no more impressive example of primitive engineering
than the terraced mountain sides of Nueva Vizcaya, beside which the
terraced hills of Japan sink into insignificance.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class=

<p>P. 185, last paragraph: The following information is furnished by
the courtesy of Prof. Winslow Upton, director of Ladd Observatory,
Brown University: &ldquo;The first and second methods enumerated in
this quotation refer to that now known as the Method by Lunar
Distances, which was already in use in the sixteenth century. In the
former the position of the moon was to be determined by its measured
distance from some star, in the latter from the sun. Since risings and
settings at an assumed horizon are specified, it is probable that the
distance between moon and sun was determined by the time interval of
their respective risings and settings. The fourth method is that still
known by the same name. The statement of the third method is obscure.
It may mean that the longitude was to be found by a measured distance
on the surface of the earth from a station whose longitude was already
known. This distance could be turned into difference of longitude if
the length corresponding to a degree of longitude in that latitude were
first determined. This method is used today in geodetic
operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>P. 218, note 184: The India House of Trade (<i lang="es">Casa de
Contrataci&oacute;n</i>) was created by a decree of Isabel of Castilla
(January 14, 1503) as both a commercial board and a tribunal; and it
partly replaced the admiralty court which had been established in
Sevilla since the thirteenth century, the quarters of the latter (in
the old Alc&aacute;zar) being assigned to the India House when the
latter was first organized. The powers of the India House increased
greatly in the course of time, and it was subordinate to no council
save that of the Indias; in 1583 a chamber of justice was added to it.
This institution was, by a decree of 1717, removed in the following
year to C&aacute;diz. An <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href=

studies made by its cosmographers, and other scientific researches

<p>&ldquo;In the Tagal language of Filipinas: Fray Francisco de San
Joseph of the convent of Madre de Dios at Alcal&aacute;, who is living
in the province of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario of Filipinas, has
printed at Bat&aacute;n, in the Tagal language of Filipinas, a
&lsquo;Book of our Lady of the Rosary;&rsquo; also another book, in the
same language, which treats of the holy sacraments of the Church; the
natives of the islands have been greatly benefited by these books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Chinese language: Fray Domingo de Nieva, of the
convent at Valladolid, who serves in the province of Filipinas, has
printed at Bat&aacute;n, in the Chinese language and likewise in the
characters used by that people, a &lsquo;Memorial of the Christian
life.&rsquo; Fray Tomas Mayor, of the convent at J&aacute;tiva, who
serves in the province of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario of

<p>P. 201: The name of the Ladrones Islands was in 1668 changed by the
missionary San V&iacute;tores to Marianas, in honor of Mariana, queen
of Felipe IV. The group contains 17 islands, which&mdash;excepting
Guam, the largest&mdash;belong to Germany, or, as it is called,
&ldquo;the German New Guinea Protectorate,&rdquo; having been
transferred to that power by Spain in 1899, together with the Carolinas
and Palaos, for 25,000,000 pesetas. The original inhabitants (a
Polynesian people) are known as Chamorros; but in later years a large
Filipino element (soldiers and others) has mingled with them, and the
people show a preponderance of the Filipino type. In 1898 the
population of the group, exclusive of Guam (which contained about 9,000
people), was 1,938. Little was done for them by the Spaniards until
1668, when a Jesuit mission went to the Marianas under the direction of
Diego Luis San V&iacute;tores. The attempts of the privileged class of
natives to keep the new faith from the common people resulted in the
loss of prestige by the former, conflict between the two classes, and
martyrdom for some of the Jesuits&mdash;San V&iacute;tores meeting
death thus on April 2, 1672. Nevertheless the missions made progress,
and a few years later the Jesuits counted eight churches, three
colleges, and over 50,000 converts (Cr&eacute;tineau-Joly, v, pp.
30&ndash;22). The military conquest of the islands by Spain was
accomplished during the years 1676&ndash;98; and they were occupied
from that time by a governor and a small force of troops. In 1828 a new
plan for the government of these islands was formed at Madrid, by which
the royal estates were suppressed, and the lands divided among the
natives, who were also provided with cattle and tools at low rates; the
governors were forbidden to trade, industries and commerce were
declared open to the natives, and free ports were named. In 1855 Felipe
de la Corte y Ruano Calderon went to the Marianas as governor, with
orders to make certain needed reforms, and to make a full report on the
condition of the islands, which he did. During the Spanish-American war
of 1898, Guam was occupied by the United States before the governor had
even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=

<p>P. 74, note 11: <i lang="es">Penas de C&aacute;mara</i> may be
rendered, in a general way, &ldquo;fines of the exchequer;&rdquo; but
it should be remembered that <i>c&aacute;mara</i>, as used in this
connection, means any royal tribunal, executive or
judicial&mdash;whether the Council of the Indias (which was often
referred to as el Consejo y C&aacute;mara de Indias), or the Audiencia
or the council of a colony, or the tribunal of accounts of any
establishment, or even the municipal council, or council under an
alcalde or alcalde-mayor. <i lang="es">Penas de c&aacute;mara</i> in
the laws of the Indies had, I think, especial reference to the various
penalties provided, especially against officials for any
non-performance of duty, by the Council of the Indias; and there was a
special board of accountants for the fund of these fines, in connection
with that Council.</p>
<p>In regard to the phrase <i lang="es">contador de resultas</i>, I
have obtained (through the kindness of Fenton R. McCreery, secretary of
the American Embassy at Mexico City) some further information,
furnished by Se&ntilde;or Jos&eacute; Algara, Under-secretary for
Foreign Affairs of Mexico. He thinks that the above phrase is
equivalent to <i lang="es">glosador</i>, [that is, to one who makes
comments or explanations, or who &ldquo;designates any amount in order
to call attention to the examination or proof of the account to which
the item belongs&rdquo; (Dom&iacute;nguez)], or to <i lang="es">segundo
contador</i> [&ldquo;a second accountant&rdquo;]. Se&ntilde;or Algara
states that the references to the accountants for the colonies in the
laws of the Indias (book viii, titles i and ii) did not define the
character and duties of the various officers, because that had already
been done in the <i lang="es">Nueva Recopilaci&oacute;n</i> (title ii,
law v, no. 1). He also cites from Nicol&aacute;s M. Serrano&rsquo;s
<i lang="es">Diccionario universal</i> the following definition of
<i lang="es">contador de resultus</i>: &ldquo;Any one of those persons
in the first grade of the chief accountancy [<i lang=
"es">Contadur&iacute;a Mayor de Cuentas</i>], which corresponds to
those officials employed in former times by the comptroller-in-chief
[<i lang="es">contador mayor</i>] who were occupied in computing or
transcribing the amounts in the account-books of the obligations which
are incurred by those persons who administer the royal revenues by
lease or by other title.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">James A.

<p>P. 99, line 3 from end of text: For &ldquo;thirty-five&rdquo; read
&ldquo;thirty-eight.&rdquo; The same correction should be made on p. 5,
line 5 from end.</p>
<p>P. 146, line 10 from end: &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; is not a quite
satisfactory rendering for the Spanish <i lang=
"es">composici&oacute;n</i>, which has a technical meaning in regard to
the possession of lands; see note on this subject in <span class=
"sc">VOL. LII</span> pp. 296, 297. &ldquo;Composition&rdquo; will
probably be the best rendering, provided that this technical meaning is
understood in such use of the word. James A. LeRoy says of this, in a
private letter: &ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Arrangement&rsquo; also conveys
somewhat the same idea&mdash;that is, the rearrangement of their
rights, or the reconciliation of rights prescribed in this decree.
<i lang="es">Composici&oacute;n de derechos</i> means, quite closely
rendered, &lsquo;reconciliation of rights,&rsquo; according to my
recollection of its use in certain contracts which I have seen here in
Mexico. It gives the idea of arbitration, to some degree, of rights
more or less in conflict which are reconciled by agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>P. 147, line 7: Consolidations of encomiendas were made, in order to
abolish those which were too small, or make a more equitable
distribution of the territory comprised in those which were very large.
Pensions were also assessed against large encomiendas, although in the
laws of the Indias it was ordained that the maximum amount of such
pensions should be 2,000 pesos. Apparently the aim of this decree was,
to provide that in extending the tenure of the encomiendas and
rearranging them the royal officials should also make allowance for the
charges against the encomiendas in the way of pensions, so
consolidating them as to accord with the decrees of previous years on
this subject. Those decrees sought to prevent an encomendero from being
deprived of a fair income by the assessment of too many pensions
against it (for wives, relatives, or dependents of previous
encomenderos of the same district; or for other services to the State,
paid for by assigning portions of remunerative encomiendas); and at the
same time aimed to restrict the income to be derived from an
encomienda, and to make these incomes nearly uniform in
value.&mdash;<span class="sc">James A. Leroy</span> (in a private

<p>P. 257, line 6: The word &ldquo;impost&rdquo; is incorrect here; the

[Spanish, <i lang="es">derecho de elecciones de gobernadorcillo</i>],
&ldquo;the [government] right in elections.&rdquo; J. A. LeRoy says of
this, in a private letter: &ldquo;It apparently refers to the right of
the superior government&mdash;generally exercised in each province by
the alcalde-mayor or provincial governor&mdash;of selecting the
gobernadorcillo of each pueblo from a list of three [<i>lerna</i>],
this list being proposed to him by the notables [<i lang=
"es">principales</i>] at the annual election. It is altogether probable
that the man chosen sometimes had to pay that official, and that Mas is
here reporting this as another of the abuses which, under the early
Spanish r&eacute;gime, the friars used to charge against the
alcaldes-mayor, in that sense, being a &lsquo;robbery&rsquo; of the
natives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>P. 266, line 2: For &ldquo;271&ndash;275&rdquo; read
&ldquo;271&ndash;273.&rdquo;</p>
<p>P. 321, line 3: The statements of this writer would make it appear
that the friars developed the resources of Negros; but that is not the
fact. The old r&eacute;gime described by Mas and Jagor failed to
develop those resources; and the modern development of Negros (which
dragged the friars reluctantly after it) was accomplished through
foreign commerce and foreign traders, a part of the general development
of the Philippines as a whole. This very document shows how, when it
was seen to be beginning, through Spanish and Spanish half-caste
planters, to whose aid British importers of machinery of the modern
sort soon after came, the friars stepped in to claim an island which
since the Spanish discovery they had sadly neglected, and to wrest its
growing curacies from native priests. This friar&rsquo;s claims (pp.
319&ndash;322) are all the more audacious in view of the proximity to
his own time of the development, through foreign agencies, which

to the Duke de Almodovar to explain the reasons for his treatment of
Raynal&rsquo;s work; they are thus given by Jos&eacute; Arias y
Miranda, in his <i lang="es">Examen cr&iacute;tico-hist&oacute;rico del
influjo que tuvo en el comercio, industria y poblaci&oacute;n de
Espa&ntilde;a su dominaci&oacute;n en Am&eacute;rica</i> (&ldquo;a work
crowned by the Real Academia de la Historia, and published by that
body, at Madrid, 1854&rdquo;), an interesting and well-written study of
that subject, with learned and valuable annotations and much reference
to standard authorities: &ldquo;In regard to the famous history of
Abb&eacute; Raynal, although it abounds in flights of imagination, in
philosophical ideas, and in passionate and declamatory judgments, it
has merited general acceptance on account of the information it
contains and the notable indications of penetration and genius which
are revealed in it. But it was not possible for the Duke de Almodovar
to make it known to his countrymen without variations and emendations,
since it was one of the works included in the <i>Indexes</i> of the
Holy Office; he therefore contrived to present it as a work imitated
rather than produced, without daring to mention even once the name of
the author, or to print his own on the title page, substituting for the
latter the anagram of &lsquo;Malo de Luque.&rsquo; This recasting was
very skilfully done; he suppressed what could not be published; and
added information and very judicious reflections upon commerce in
general and on that of our [Spanish] possessions. Although this history
belongs properly to our literature, since it is not a translation, it
has never been reprinted since the first edition, copies of which are
now becoming rare.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">P. 55. note: The name Palaos (also written Palau or
Pelew) is applied to the western group of the Carolinas Archipelago,
which extends in a general east and west direction from the region
south of the Marianas. Although nominally the property of Spain, these
islands were greatly neglected by the Spaniards, even into the
nineteenth century. Their attention was directed for a time to the
Palaos by the event described in Clain&rsquo;s letter, and various
attempts were made, but unsuccessfully, to establish Christian missions
therein, two Jesuits, Duberon and Jos&eacute; Cortil, being killed by
natives in 1710, and another, Antonio Cantova, meeting the same fate in
1731. In the latter half of the last century, German interests gained
ascendency in the islands, which led to their absorption by Germany.
Jagor cites (<i lang="de">Reisen</i>, pp. 215, 216) several historical
instances of Palaos islanders being carried by storms to the coasts of
Filipinas; and adds, &ldquo;Later, I had in Manila an opportunity to
photograph a group of people from the Pal&aacute;os and Caroline
Islands, who a year previously had been cast by a storm on the coast of
Samar.&rdquo; He also says (p. 203): &ldquo;As Dr. Gr&auml;ffe (who
spent many years in the Micronesas) informs me, Pal&aacute;os is an
indefinite expression, like Kanaka and so many others, and certainly
does not designate the inhabitants of the Pelew group
exclusively.&rdquo; Regarding these islands, see Montero y

11: In the <i>Philippine Journal of Science</i> (published by the
Bureau of Science, Manila), for October, 1906, is an interesting paper
on &ldquo;The Non-Christian Tribes of Northern Luzon,&rdquo; by Dean C.
Worcester, secretary of the interior in the government of the islands.
He endeavors to furnish a systematic classification of these tribes;
repeats the lists made by the Jesuits, Professor Blumentritt, and Dr.
Barrows, criticizing each of these, and in some respects differing from
their methods; and then enumerates the separate tribes, as classified
by himself&mdash;giving under each, the synonyms of the tribal name,
with other names which may be classed under this; &ldquo;its habitat,
so far as it is at present known;&rdquo; and description of its people,
and of their dress, homes, mode of life, occupations, customs, etc. A
similar paper on those tribes in Southern Luzon is announced for the
coming year. For these papers Worcester has utilized personal
observations made on these peoples not only by himself, but by numerous
other government officials both civil and military, during the years
1900&ndash;06; and special information regarding them obtained in the
census enumeration of 1903. He says (p. 802): &ldquo;It is not too much
to say that hardly a <i lang="es">rancheria</i> now remains in the
Cordillera Central and its foothills, except in the district of Apayos,
which has not been visited by Americans, while even in the latter
district twenty-nine of the more important rancherias have been
visited.&rdquo; The above paper contains excellent illustrations made
from 208 photographs, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href=
"#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>taken by Worcester himself or
other government officials. Other valuable papers announced for the
<i>Journal</i> in 1907 are: &ldquo;The Tagbanua and Mangyan
Alphabets,&rdquo; by T. H. Pardo de Tavera; &ldquo;The Subanos of the
Zamboangan Peninsula,&rdquo; by Edwin B. Christie; and &ldquo;Primitive
Philippine Fire-making Apparatus,&rdquo; by Dean C. Worcester.</p>
<p>P. 78, note 13: Worcester recognizes but seven distinct
non-Christian tribes in northern Luzon: the Negritos, Ilongots
(Ibilaos), Kalingas, Ifugaos, Bontoc Igorots, Lepanto-Benguet Igorots,
and Tinguians. He says of some of these tribal designations
(&ldquo;Non-Christian Tribes of N. Luzon,&rdquo; p. 804): &ldquo;The
<i>Altasanes</i>, <i>Ifumangies</i> [the same as <i>Jumangi</i>],
<i>Ileabanes</i>, and <i>Panuipuyes</i> do not exist. In all
probability these latter names were taken from those of <i lang=
"es">rancherias</i> which have long since disappeared. While some of
the larger <i lang="es">rancherias</i> in northern Luzon are very old,
others are of recent origin and the names and locations of these
settlements are constantly changing.&rdquo;</p>

information furnished by Dr. N. M. Saleeby, the error in the text being

went to Cotabato, Mindanao, in May, 1901, as a captain and assistant
surgeon U.S.V., and served in that capacity until February 1, 1903.
From the latter date until June 30, 1906, I served as superintendent of
schools, and member of the legislative council for the Moro Province. I
am a naturalized American citizen, and was born in a Christian home in
Lebanon, Syria.&rdquo; He is now connected with the Bureau of Science

<p>P. 255, lines 3&ndash;5 from end: Up to the beginning of the
sixteenth century, Toledo was the chief city in Spain in manufacturing
silk; it has been estimated that this industry gave employment there to
at least 100,000 people. Gaspar Naranjo, &ldquo;who traveled through
Espa&ntilde;a late in the seventeenth century, asserts that, according
to his knowledge, in 1480 Toledo consumed 450,000 libras of silk, which
could furnish the supply for 15,000 looms. Although this number was
greatly lessened when the Escorial was completed, yet from the looms of
Toledo proceeded the richest silks for church adornments, ribbons, and
hangings. In the year 1651 Toledo still counted 5,000 looms in
operation, although not all within the city; a little afterward, there
were not more than two thousand; in 1714 they were reduced to seventy,
and finally to none at all. When the remnants of this manufacture left
Toledo, that of Valencia gained strength, but never to the extent which
might have been if legislation had permitted it. The Moors had left
that of Granada in the best condition; years after the conquest it
maintained 5,000 spinning-wheels, and the kingdom yielded a million
libras of good silk; but just at this point began the exactions of the
revenue officials, and likewise, in consequence, the decadence of this
industry. It was declared subject to the payment of al&ccedil;abala,
which was a tax of fourteen per cent when once the tenth was applied as
an ecclesiastical income; eight maraved&iacute;s besides were charged
to it for the impost called <i lang="es">tortil</i> [<i>i.e.</i>,
spiral?], and nine maraved&iacute;s more for a municipal tax. When with
the increase from successive impositions the management of this revenue
became too complicated, all these duties were combined in one; and then
it was seen that every libra of silk paid, as its share of the taxes,
the enormous amount of very nearly fifteen and one-half reals. With the
increase in taxes, the production steadily diminished; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>by
1643, that of Granada had decreased from a million to one-fourth of
that amount, and not long afterward to 80,000, and even less. The silk
industry, thus burdened, had to compete with that of Genoa, whence
large shipments of silk goods were freely imported into Spanish ports,
and sold at lower prices than the goods made in Espa&ntilde;a; and a
mortal blow was dealt to it when the exportation of Spanish silks was
prohibited, and sumptuary laws reserved the use of silk fabrics to a
few classes. It is astonishing that this industry has been able to
survive up to the present epoch, although it is in a languishing
condition.<span class="corr" id="xd27e7097" title=

&ldquo;white coat.&rdquo; J. A. LeRoy says of this, in a private
letter: &ldquo;<i lang="es">Americana</i> here means a short or sack
coat, of white drill or duck, buttoned up to the throat, and worn with
only a gauze undershirt beneath it, and the trousers (often white
also). It is the common garb of Europeans and upper-class natives in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>the tropics. This usage among Spaniards seems to
have died out in Spanish America, but the word is common in the
Philippines, where it is probably a survival from earlier
Spanish-American usage, transplanted to those islands. Many Spanish
writers mention with contempt the way in which class distinctions in
dress vanished among Spaniards in the Philippines (save, of course,
among the military, ecclesiastical, and high official classes). So too,
the donning of the <i lang="es">Americana</i> meant the assumption of
social prestige or aspirations by the Filipinos. Only a few years ago,
nearly all the latter wore the gauze shirt outside of the trousers; but
in recent years the younger men of education, even in the villages, and
gradually the older men, have been adopting the <i lang=
"es">Americana</i> for ordinary wear&mdash;a change which has been
greatly accelerated during American occupation.&rdquo;</p>

Volume 52, 1841-1898, by Various

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, VOLUME 52 ***

***** This file should be named 57431-h.htm or 57431-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:
        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/7/4/3/57431/

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This file was produced from images generously
made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
